The finest in South East Asia. There are other galleries here too devoted to the history of art in Singapore & the region, exploring the deep connections between the changes in Singapore and their impact on wider culture and the art scene. I learned so much this morning as this is only my second visit to Singapore and my first with my partner.\n\nThis is where today‚Äôs visit was so special. I love art and have done so for many decades, simply put, my partner is not as interested in it as I am. Yet this visit triggered something. What I thought would only be a 1-2 hours at most visit before my partner became restless turned into a half day visit where quite often we wondered off in different directions exploring on our own only for me to discover my partner intently viewing modern works & sculptures and taking lots and lots of photos of the architecture of the amazing building too. \n\nWhen I asked what was different, the response was simply it did not feel like a normal art gallery and the layout and architecture all combined to create an inviting space for exploration & discovery. I hope this is the start of something new for us. Thank you National Gallery Singapore!"

However, there was a lot of renovation work going on so I'm not sure I got to see this old Hindu temple in any better light. \n\nIf you happen to be near Chinatown, then it is worth a visit but not a long one, as there is not a huge amount to see. The figures and statues are very colourful, as were the ceiling paintings. Hopefully the renovations are now complete."

If you are in the area anyway (as it is in Chinatown near other better attractions like the buddhist tooth relic temple) then perhaps worth popping your head in.

Worth a stop if you are in the area."

Its nice and tranquil in here but having been to Armenia itself it's a bit of a disappointing experience. In Yerevan you would see lots of religious paintings and frescoes inside and there would be the smell of incense. This was largely plain white and no orthodox dome. Pop in and light a candle but dont worry if you miss it."

Its exterior looks like so many early 19th Century churches in the US.  However, inside it is a very interesting circular nave and sanctuary, still in a very historic setting.  While we peeked in we could not take pictures due to an event.  However it is a great structure to visit.  Exterior alone is beautiful."

We were eventually advised that a service in the Cantonese language was about to commence and welcome to remain. Although the language was alien to us, many of the hymns and services were recognisable.\nThe present building dates to 1856 and consecrated in 1862. Built in the neo-Gothic architectural style, it replaced the earlier church which had its foundations laid in 1835. The Cathedral was declared a national monument in 1973."

Definitely worth our brief visit."

Gazetted as a national monument on 1973, you‚Äôll stand in awe at its majestic facade, with extended pinnacles and a glossy white exterior. Take a coffee break and enjoy our free wifi at The Cathedral Cafe which is conveniently located beside the City Hall MRT entrance (North Bridge Road).",

          "text": "Review of Thian Hock Keng Temple, 158 Telok Ayer Street, Singapore\n\nExit Telok Ayer MRT station on the corner of the intersection with Cross Street and head south along Telok Ayer Street (towards the Amoy Street Food Centre). Stay on the same side of the street. You‚Äôre heading towards the high-rise buildings of the modern CBD along what used to be the extent of the original shoreline.\n\nFive minutes/170 m later the road opens out with three-story early 20th C. buildings on both sides of the road until you arrive opposite Thian Hock Keng Temple. There‚Äôs this gorgeous completely out-of-place Chinese architectural structure lining the other side of the street with a wavy roofline seemingly imitating the surf that once pounded the beaches hereabouts. The colours are all green and gold and match the handful of trees along the street. Ornamental dragons dance along the apex of the roof symbolising the justice, power and strength of the Temple.\n\nThere‚Äôs a description of the Temple attached to the wall that provides some historical background. It also gives that raison d‚Äô√™tre for being there; Chinese migrants arriving safely in sea vessels at their first place of embarkation >200 years ago and pleased to give thanks to the Sea Goddess Mazu. Stories and legends relate to the cult of Mazu/Mazuism from the 12th C. on with the majority of modern followers based upon the coastal Chinese province of Fuji and migrant communities in SE Asia ‚Äì particularly the island of Taiwan.\n\nThe Temple of Heavenly Happiness (in English translation) was first established in 1821 in a joss house ‚Äì a simple hut built of local materials before the dedicated temple building was constructed 20 years later. Regular investment with rebuilding, renovation and maintenance followed during the next 180 years with support from local communities. In turn, the original buildings were used for community, social and educational purposes as Singapore developed. The Temple was substantially renovated 25 years ago ‚Äì such that it gained UNESCO heritage recognition. On 06 July 1973 ‚Äì 50 years ago ‚Äì the Temple was gazetted a National Monument.\n\nInside and out, the design and decorative nature of the buildings overwhelm visitors unfamiliar with temples. The Temple has a traditional three-hall design ‚Äì Entrance, Main and Rear. Enter by the main door off the street ‚Äì with a small door on either side ‚Äì into the Entrance Hall and through into the Main Hall. Here is where you find the shrine of Mazu with a supportive deity on either side. This is where the majority of worshippers gather.\n\nTake time to wander the courtyard at the rear including the two covered walkways opposite one to the other ‚Äì carved pillars, decorated ceilings with hanging lights and floors with patterned tiles. Everything clean, well-presented and brilliantly coloured ‚Äì reflecting original classical Southern Chinese architecture. On either side of the temple are pagodas.\n\nThe temple overwhelms with the intricate detail of design, construction and meaning ‚Äì much of this based upon the concept of feng shui. This is a Chinese system for positioning a building and the objects within the building such that they agree with the associated spiritual forces which brings health and happiness to believers. Scattered around the temple are several shrines dedicated to different deities, and side halls available for private meditation.\n\nWe had the Temple largely to ourselves ‚Äì there were a few visitors most of whom appeared to be slowly wandering around. The place was peaceful/quiet, but you could pick up the noise from the commercial shops, vehicles and people outside on Telok Ayer Street.\n\nIt had been an interesting visit ‚Äì typical of the uninitiated. It would have been useful to have had a pamphlet or guidebook to provide an introduction to those of us unfamiliar with the design, purpose, objectivity/meaning of the different features, etc. within the Temple.\n\nPeter Steele\n11 October 2024"

The journey became alive as my sister-in-law remembered, shared and narrated about the colonial eras of the Portuguese, Dutch and the British with an Asian element to our heritage.  We were immersed in the Eurasian origins, culture, history, traditions, surnames, language ‚Äì Kristang and food.   \n\nThe gallery is a little off the tourist belt.  If you love history, culture, and curious about Eurasian ‚Äì It‚Äôs No Sweat to You!  Just hop on the mrt, or just do Grab or book a guided tour.  You will enjoy it as it is something different.  After the walk-about, don‚Äôt miss to try the Eurasian food at Quentin‚Äôs Eurasian restaurant located at the same building.  Enjoy!"

Newspapers cutting and lots of photos that shown how the Eurasians stay in Singapore thru the times. Maybe with guided tour, you will enjoy even more. However, walking on our own and reading and viewing the exhibits at own pace does wonders too. Recommended to cater at least 1 hour to walk thru the galleries."

It‚Äôs also free but be early , it‚Äôs packed. \nShow is 7.45 pm and 8.45 pm. Takes approximately 15 min.\nLots of Statues , eateries and restrooms in the park \nMRT is 15 min walk away"

My husband and I had just about wrapped up our visit to the wonderful cloud forest but we were still clueless on navigating outside the gardens. It was right as we were leaving when we approached a guide, Hazik, who at first seemed at a rush with his clipboard in hand but stopped all he was doing to assist us. He not only kindly explained the directions we requested but started an insightful conversation and even assisted in planning out a detailed itinerary for our brief stay in Singapur. We would like to extend our gratitude for his kindness and patience in guiding us which ultimately was the highlight of our trip to the gardens!"

My time in the city was limited, but I still ended up spending basically one entire day roaming the grounds and exploring the different facilities (e.g. Flower Dome, Supertree Grove, Cloud Forest). Tickets are available at various entry points for any or all areas you‚Äôd like to see, which, for me, was everything. The cost is pricey but 1000% worth the investment. Multiple food vendors are on the premises. Nearby GBTB (abbreviated name) are Marina Bay Sands (the hotel/casino/shopping mall) and the waterfront promenade, plus a metro station (Bayfront MRT) is connected to everything so one needn‚Äôt walk outdoors too much if hot and humid."

For example, the facial did not have the scrub or treatment as described in the menu; the massage was weak and did not hit any pressure points.  The reception area was tiny and when we arrived, the therapists were sprawled on the reception table and sitting in the guest chairs and yakking away.   We were shown t a small lounge which seated 2 when there were 3 of us.  We were served with lukewarm tea and water.  It was altogether an unpleasant experience.  Not recommended at all."

It's about a 400 m walk up a sideroad to the entrance to the cemetery.  \n\nIt is huge, and rather heartbreaking when you see the ages of many of the people buried here.  There is also a large pavilion with plaques listing people who were cremated or whose bodies were not located.  The pavilion can be useful for shelter if one of Singapore's frequent but often brief rain showers occurs while you are here!\n\nThe displays and plaques near the entrance were useful to get some idea of Singapore history in WWII, including one which shows the significant battle sites."

      "description": "Location Information The Commonwealth War Graves Commission's Kranji War Cemetery is 22 kilometres north of the city of Singapore, on the north side of Singapore Island overlooking the Straits of Johore. It is located just to the West of the Singapore-Johore road (Bukit Timah Expressway) on Woodlands Road, just to the south of the crossroads with Turf Club Avenue and Kranji Road. There is a short approach road from the main road. The Cemetery is known locally as Kranji Memorial and one must be sure of the address before boarding a taxi as most taxi drivers do not know the Cemetery. There are also bus stops on the main road facing the Cemetery. The Kranji MRT (train) terminal is a short distance from the Cemetery, approximately 10 to 15 minutes away by foot. A previous visitor has advised us that a small map of the route can be obtained from the MRT ticket office. Visiting Information Kranji War Cemetery is open every day 07:00-18:30. The cemetery is constructed on a hill with the means of access being via three flights of steps, rising over four metres from the road level, which makes wheelchair access to this site impossible.",

Unfortunately, the plaque is not very popular, and a lot of construction work was going on around this in the park. It took a great effort to locate this. A book shaped structure with inscription of the historical events is inscripted on it. The area is not maintained with the care that should have been given.

          "title": "A Country That Remembers Its Heroes",
          "text": "Reflections at Bukit Chandu is a memorial to what a specific handful of soldiers did during the battle of Singapore.  Which makes it a true memorial to individual men, unlike almost every other war memorial.   I‚Äôve visited battlefields from Pearl Harbor to Passchendaele, and few of them discuss any individual common soldiers.  Gettysburg has lots of monuments honouring the battle‚Äôs combatants, but the only ones you‚Äôll see individualized in any way are the generals.   At Verdun, an ossuary holds the bones of at least 130,000 dead, to honour of their ‚Äúmemory,‚Äù but no one knows who any of them were or even on which side they fought, so it lets you remember those who cannot be remembered.   By comparison with the 165,000 combatants at Gettysburg or the 700,000 casualties at Verdun, the number of defenders at Bukit Chandu was quite small.  And as for commanding generals, neither Arthur Percival nor Tomoyuki Yamashita was anywhere near that ridge.  \n\nSeveral years ago I reviewed the Menin Gate in Ypers for TripAdvisor and wrote: ‚ÄúThe Menin Gate is ‚Ä¶ thought-provoking ‚Ä¶ because ‚Ä¶ [it] allows visitors to delve down to the personal tragedies of individual men and their families.‚Äù  This is even truer of Reflections at Bukit Chandu.  At Menin Gate, YOU have to do the delving down; at Reflections at Bukit Chandu, the memorial does it for you.\n\nThe Fall of Singapore was the largest military surrender in British history.  For days Malay troops had been among those fighting Japanese invaders whose plans, equipment, elan, and generalship all were vastly superior.  The museum Reflections at Bukit Chandu does touch on a wide range of subjects related to the disaster, but its focus is on one small part of the overall battle, Bukit Chandu.    \n\nOn the night of January 8th,1942, the Japanese crossed the Strait of Johor and landed on northwestern Singapore Island.  By the 9th, defending Aussie troops, denied reinforcement by Percival, made a forced retreat.  The Japanese, with air support and tanks, neither of which the defenders had, began sweeping southeast toward, among other places, Bukit Chandu.  Their target was the area along Alexandra Road, where the British ammunition, supply depots, oil reserves, and Alexandra military hospital, were concentrated.   The thin red line opposing them was the under-equipped 1st Malaya Infantry Brigade, consisting of a regiment of Lancashiremen and another of Malays.  One defensive position on Bukit Chandu was the Pasir Panjang ridge, where a few dozen Malays commanded by a 27-year-old Malay junior officer, 2nd Lt. Adnan Saidi, took the brunt of the attack.  The Japanese tried a ruse, marching forward troops in formation wearing uniforms taken from a Punjabi unit that had already surrendered during the campaign in Malaya, turbans and all.  Saidi recognized the ruse and the Malays routed the ‚ÄúPunjabi‚Äù impostors.  Against overwhelming odds, Saidi and his men held out, despite having little but a mortar and a few machine-guns, and running out of food, ammo, and mortar shells (see Mortar Monument). \n\nAfter two days of stubborn defence on Pasir Panjang, the Japanese finally overran the Malay positions.  Saidi, who was seriously wounded, was hung him upside down from a tree and then repeatedly bayoneted until dead.  The Japanese then went on to massacre the doctors, nurses and wounded patients at Alexandra Hospital.  Other Malay junior officers were told that they had to choose between swearing loyalty to the Japanese, or death.  When the young junior officers refused to do so, they were murdered as well.\n\nThe focus of this museum is on 2nd Lt. Adnan Saidi and his company of men, and beyond that, to the Malaya Regiment‚Äîthough the museum does look at the large picture of the Fall of Singapore as well.  As the memorial itself says:  ‚ÄúA country that does not remember its heroes, doesn‚Äôt deserve to have any.‚Äù\n\nNote that rating Reflections at Bukit Chandu is currently undergoing renovations."

And as a tourist, looking for a sense of home away from home, I got what I wanted, a Saturday service. The warm handshakes later , the greeting from others who are regular as well as regular seasonal, was more than welcoming, and I am still in contact with them years later. This was all a bonus and made for a lovely extended morning at least until 2 pm. The best part. Was this time my hotel was actually just behind the building so I did not require transport.\nThe rabbi, is a very genuine fellow, warm and welcoming, and the guest speaker who happened to be there was interesting and informative.

Also as adjacent school, social building with dining hall and chapel, community rooms. They are Sephardim and Orthodox. So they don't really care about non-Jews. Jews are welcomed but it's not like in the West. Women may come to services but must sit upstairs in the gallery. \n\nNo page announcements. Occasionally, someone on the pulpit will announce a prayer, as well as Kaddish. If you are Jewish and familiar with the service, you will be fine. If not, forget it. Afterwards, you will be invited to the Kiddush and perhaps a full lunch, on weeks they have it. Free. Often there is a separate service for Ashkenazim in the Ballas building chapel. Again, Orthodox; women sit apart. If you are called to the Torah with your mother's name as well as your father's, forget it. But any Jewish male will be given an honor.\n\nAlso: don't forget to go into the Ark after the service to see all the Tiorah scrolls, in either wood or silver covers, from the congregation as welll as from vanished Jewish communities in Penang, Jakarta. Maybe 20 there, as well as the scrolls used by the congregation.\n\nIf you are an ex-pat, likely someone may invite you home for a meal or for a holiday, say, if you work in KL or Jakarta and come to Singapore for business or just to find a synagogue. \n\nNumbers have increased past 15 years in part because of growing ex-pat community, largely from U.S. and Canada. Even an Israeli or two."

We also learnt more about Gems and other precious stones and especially the 77 Carats diamond! There is also has an interesting plot of small land with various plants and trees within the Malay Heritage Center.\n\nAlso we found out that my husband lived in the same road as Mr Omar Ahmad! It was during the mid 60s to early 80s when he was living with his grandparents!! What a nice finding! I am quite sure his late grandparents might even know Mr Omar Ahmad!\n\nHighly recommended to family outings."

They showcase stories and artifacts from both Singapore's national collection as well as contributions from the local community. It is a reflection of Kampong Glam's historical significance as well as the contribution of the local Malay society. The structure was once of traditional timber built on stilts, which has been thoroughly renovated over time. It is open from Tuesday to Sunday, 10:00am to 6:00pm, with free admission for all Singaporeans & Permanent Residents. A couple of hours can be easily spent here."

Don‚Äôt come here unless you want to pay tourist prices to have your experience completely ruined by around 100 noisy school children who completely take over the space. My experience was completely ruined by about 5 separate groups of loud school children, who took over every room I went to! Why should I pay the tourist entrance fee which is way more expensive and have these children, who paid nothing to enter, completely ruin the whole experience?! Staff couldn‚Äôt care less and allow children to run wild throughout the museum! Would never return here! And would advise to check before paying the entrance fee to see if school trips are booked in that day. The venue is small and should not be allowing so many groups of school children to enter at the same time! Not fair on paying customers!"

We got a tray and filled it with food. Then we went to the cashier to get it weighed. It costs $3.60 per 100gm.  We can take as much or as little as we want.  Brown rice, white rice and porridge are free. So are the drinks and fruit.  It‚Äôs a great idea because there was no waste.  Everyone was bringing their leftovers home.

      "description": "Singapore Art Museum opened in 1996 as the first art museum in Singapore. Also known as SAM, the museum presents contemporary art from a Southeast Asian perspective for artists, art lovers and the art curious in multiple venues across the island, including a new anchor venue in the historic port area of Tanjong Pagar. SAM‚Äôs space at Tanjong Pagar Distripark houses expansive galleries for bold art presentations, a coffee bookshop by the port, and versatile spaces for programmes and collaborations. SAM is building one of the world's most important public collections of Southeast Asian contemporary art, with the aim of connecting the art and the artists to the public and future generations through exhibitions, programmes, and meaningful encounters with contemporary art.",

So unless you‚Äôve literally never encountered Islam, then stick to admiring the building from the outside only."

Also visitors are asked to remove their shoes."

      "description": "With a history dating back to its inception in 1887, the National Museum of Singapore is the nation's oldest museum with a progressive mind. Its galleries adopt cutting-edge and multi-perspective ways of presenting history and culture to redefine conventional museum experience. A cultural and architectural landmark in Singapore, the Museum hosts innovative festivals and events all year round-the dynamic Night Festival, visually arresting art installations, as well as amazing performances and film screenings-in addition to presenting thought-provoking exhibitions involving critically important collections of artefacts. The programming is supported by a wide range of facilities and services including F&B, retail and a Resource Centre. The National Museum of Singapore re-opened in December 2006 after a three-year redevelopment, and celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2012. The Museum refreshed its permanent galleries and re-opened them on 19 September 2015 for Singapore's Golden Jubilee.",

We were able to check in early & Andy - the receptionist really came through for us! He recognized from my booking that we're celebrating our anniversary so he upgraded us to a suite room, with the same view overlooking the Gardens on 30th floor. OMG, our suite room was spectacular!!! The housekeeping staff was also very efficient and welcoming. Making sure that we're always taken care of as far as stocking our room every time we're gone, the things we used gets replaced & cleaned up. We're glad to spend this much booking this hotel. It's a one in a lifetime experience. The infinity pool was also amazing! I would definitely recommend to everyone to celebrate their special day here at the MBS hotel. Everything is perfect and breathtaking!!!\n\nThe Rise buffet was amazing! We had dinner and very pleased with the food selection and service. Make sure you sign up for Marina Bay Sands app, you get rewards points/cash that you can use to any of their restaurants & stores, just make sure to present your membership number every time you pay. \n\nLastly,  hands up  to Andy at the hotel reception.

Lower relative temps at that time plus overcast made the trek to Henderson Wave nicer.\n\nIf you can take a grab car or taxi and get dropped off in the parking lot.  From there it was a paved path up which was a much easier approach than the stairs near the bus stop.\n\nThe wave itself was a combination of wood and metal with views from both sides.  The undulating wave design gave the bridge its  distinctive look though it‚Äôs built like most bridges.  To get a better photo and view of the bridge it was best viewed from the middle of the staircase leading down to Henderson Road.\n\nIt took me around 10 minutes to cross including stops to take photos as well as read the Discovery Walk signs that gave a quick history but also point out some of the more significant buildings from that vantage point.\n\nFrom here, I continued my walk to Fraser Point at the top of Mount Fraser Park and the MarangTrail to the Harbourfront MRT station."

We had to find building G, and then were turned away because we didn‚Äôt have cash!  Being determined to do this we asked where the nearest cash point ATM was (over and along the road) so armed with our cash ($6 per person) we made our way back. We then got tripped up because we didn‚Äôt have one of the ID documents needed to access the turnstile (not sure what they were, they seemed to be travel docs). I think the man in the ticket office felt sorry for us as he handed us his own personal access pass if we left behind a driving licence as collateral. \n\nOur persistence paid off and we were blown away by the views. You can walk all around the top of all 6 towers. Mainly this was the residents doing this at the time we came (6pm) so it wasn‚Äôt at all crowded"

          "text": "Yes, in case you may not be aware, The Pinnacle @Duxton is Singapore‚Äôs tallest public housing project.\n\nFirst thing first - how to get there?\n\nThere are two MRT stations nearby: Tanjong Pagar (East West Line, green colour) and Maxwell (Thomson East Coast Line, brown colour).\n\nI took the MRT to Maxwell Station as I‚Äôd planned to have an early dinner before going to the Pinnacle. There is a hawker centre, Maxwell Food Centre, which is situated above the Maxwell Station. If you go to the hawker centre before 6.00pm, it will be relatively easy to get a table.\n\nFrom Maxwell Station it‚Äôs an easy 10 minute walk to The Pinnacle. \n\nBefore you get there, I will suggest that each person has a EZ Link card (which you use for taking buses and MRT rides) and a Singapore phone (for emergency, in case you need to make a call).\n\nWhen you reach The Pinnacle @Duxton, do note that this is a big project, look for Block 1G. \n\nThen take the lift to Level 1 (you are most likely to arrive at Level 3, which you may think that it‚Äôs the ground floor, but it‚Äôs not).\n\nAt Level 1, look for the tiny Security Office or MA‚Äôs office (follow the white signboard). The duty security guard will ask you for SGD 6.00 per person and your EZ Link card.\n\nThen head to the lift lobby, take Lift A or B to Level 50. \n\nThere is a tall turnstile at Level 50, which you will need to tap using your EZ Link card to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù the gate.\n\nWhen I tried to exit when I was there, the turnstile didn‚Äôt work well so I had to call the Security Office (phone number listed at the gate) for them to remotely unlock the gate for me. So it‚Äôll be handy if you have a Singapore phone with you, just in case you need to call for help.\n\nThe best time to go is 6.30pm to enjoy the sunset view. \n\nAt the sky deck you could take a leisurely stroll and take in the views of the container port, Chinatown and the CBD. It‚Äôs definitely worth a visit."

The parapets of the minaret are inset with green glazed Chinese porcelain tiles.  The minaret consists of an eight-sided peak atop a two-tiered octagonal tower on a square base.  There are Doric capitals on the first three tiers of the minaret.  The minaret tower is believed to be a copy of the tower spire erected on the first St Andrew's Church.\nThe minaret tilted slightly due to the sandy soil on which it was built, leading it to be nicknamed \"Leaning Tower of Singapore\".  This mosque was gazetted as a national monument in 1973."

My friend was blown away by the richness of the Chinese culture depicted by the park grounds and said Haw Par Villa and the Singapore tourism agency should really publicise the park more. He felt it would be great for kids. As for me, I had read Tripadvisor reviews that going with a guided tour made all the difference so I kept waiting for a time I could go with a tour to visit the park. Sad to say, somehow all the permanent staff are leaving the park so the night tour was cancelled since end 2024 and the weekend 11am tour was also not available due to staff shortage on the day we went. We did manage to join a 10.30am Hell's Museum tour but I would say that the tour wasn't worth the hype. The \"death rites\" around the world (e.g. Zoroastrianism, Abrahamic faiths etc) educational piece does not work with Haw Par Villa. It adds little to the experience and is incongruous with Haw Par Villa being more a Chinese / Singaporean culture venue. I would suggest saying look Haw Par Villa is free to enter, so for the Hell's Court part, it is fair if we charge a S$10 fee for you to enter if you want to see the Hell's Court part.  I hope park management and the Singaporean authorities will keep Haw Par Villa a part of Singapore.  The free park grounds are well worth a leisurely 1-hour stroll especially with kids and I would suggest we pay $10 to see the Hell's Courts as well"

The sculptures in the park are a bit dilapidated but what fun!  We intended to visit Hell's Museum so finding the sculpture park was a bonus.  We were a little unsure about Hell's Museum as we thought it might be too religious/spiritual for us. However, it was the best thing we did in Singapore.  The tour explained different religions' views on death and the afterlife and the visit to the models of the Ten Courts of Hell was absolutely fascinating.  Entrance to the museum gives you 10% discount in the cafe.  It's probably a \"Marmite\" attraction but we loved it."

If you have the courage, you may gaze into the mirror of truth and see how you appeared at the time, whether you were a saint or wicked. I was obviously bad for some reason since my reflection looked like the face of the devil. There is a wealth of iconography that illustrates several Chinese mythological tales, making it a wonderful place to take children to study."

Erected by migrants from Fujian province of China over 100 years ago and dedicated as a National monument in 1978 Hong San See is a nice enough temple but certainly not the most stunning I've ever seen, whether it was going through some renovation I'm not sure but the exterior terrace in particular just seemed untidy and cluttered with 'stuff'.  The temple opens daily from 7am to 6pm, I was lucky as I got there at 6:30pm but the temple curator was just locking up and let me in for 10 minutes... What a very nice guy."

It moved from its original site on Wallich Road to its present site. It is a symbol of how migrants, seeking better fortunes in foreign lands, can strike success and wealth on the back of industry and wisdom. Built in traditional Chinese architectural style, the temple boasts of rich decorations such as ornamental columns, granite plaques and magnificent prayer halls and is now a gazetted national monument, since 1978. I was almost shocked by how this historic building stands quietly among modern amenities and urban features of the River Valley area. It stands on a hilly position, accessible after a flight of stairs. The resident deity is Guangze Zun Wang. \nConstruction materials came from China, such as wood carvings and stone dragon columns. It has received several renovations over the years. in 2010, it received an Award of Excellence from the UNESCO. Columns are decorated very well; some features were unusual to my eyes. Beams of the ceiling contain information plaques and poetry. This place is stunningly beautiful, the architecture is simply magnificent and is open daily, closing exactly by 5pm (the friendly caretaker chatted about its history and later gave me a heads-up about closing time). It is permitted to take photos, of course keeping sensitivity to other devotees."

This was an outstanding museum based in the old original building owed by a master tailor in the 1950's.  It was an all encompassing journey through time with the static displays augmented by a very good audio unit.  We were so engrossed in all the detail that we ended up spending over 2 hrs wandering up and down the three level building.  It was a journey well taken."

The first one addresses themes about what it means to be Chinese, especially for overseas Chinese and those who have been abroad for several generations. These themes are similar to some of the exhibits in the Peranakan Museum. The Nantah Exhibition is mainly old photos of Nanyang University, later Nanyang Technological Institute, and finally the present-day Nanyang Technological University. It is interesting to see if you are a student or staff at NTU, but might not be so exciting for a general audience.\nI recommend 1 hr for a quick overview, or 2 hours if you like to read every plaque :)\nFree entry for NTU staff and students."

This was the highlight of our visit to Singapore."

Our entry fee included an audio visual guide that was really useful for providing context throughout the tour. The centre has taken great effort to provide a realistic view of the way in which many Chinese people lived in the typical housing seen through Chinatown. From the tailor shop on the first floor to the tenanted cubicles rented out on the second floor it shined a light in the hardships of day to day living in Chinatown as relatively recently as the 1950s. \nThe Heritage Centre is close to the Chinatown MRT and is air conditioned."

Granted they were created by advertising agencies and not too many trade secrets should be given away but how did they come by that striking paper covering of that Tiger Balm container, the particular colors used for eg seeing that it's so distinctive that it's not been changed for years?\nOne piece though was memorable and well-presented, the plastic Kopitiam chair where it's explained that every part is purposefully designed, the hole in the centre for easy lifting up and chaining chairs together at closing time, congratulations on curating that piece, exactly what a viewer wants to see and understand about a particular design!\nPerhaps an attendant could be stationed in the hall as one large group of inconsiderate viewers were talking and laughing loudly, treating the venue as their place of socialisation while other visitors were trying to concentrate on the exhibits. \nNot a security guard in sight except behind the desk at the main entrance! \n"

Fitting, then, that it should dedicate a National Centre to Design in a decade when the discipline has become recognised as including, but also being much more than, the craft of artisans. Across schools, workplaces and government,  Singapore has taken \"Design Thinking\" to heart, teaching it as a key to transforming national and corporate strategy into innovation and positive change. \n\nIn the first decades of nation building, when rapid economic growth was seen as the priority, art,  design and creativity was not emphasised as a national priority. Today, however, Singapore's National Design Centre sits at the heart of a new creative quarter whose students and practitioners will intentionally shape the products, services,  experiences and businesses of tomorrow.  Seen that way, the National Design Centre is becoming more than an excellent exhibition venue and a great place for coffee or a creative meeting with friends and colleagues. It's also a gathering place for those who want to apply creativity to create different dimensions of value for this island nation's future. Well worth a visit. "

Its elegant Victorian facade is well-preserved, so are its famed clock tower and original passageway connecting the theatre and concert hall. Walk through this charming building to see its heritage elements carefully conserved, namely its 152-year-old twin domes. Providing mid-sized performance venues, VTVCH fills a gap in the local arts scene, and now has improved acoustics, music and dance rehearsal rooms and state-of-the-art facilities.",

From locals favourite like chicken rice to MALA noodles.\n\nBack to the Museum: there are various types of porcelains from different dynasties and also if you are interested in Chinese paintings and calligraphy, there is a small collection. This is one of the few places in SG where it is free entrance and it is air conditioned!\n\nThe nearest train station is either Kent Ridge or Clementi MRT station.

NUS has a rich history from its inception as University of Malaya in 1949 after merging of King Edward VII College of Medicine and Raffles College. After the Separation of Malaysia and Singapore, UM was dichotomised into University of Malaya (in Kuala Lumpur) and University of Singapore which subsequently became NUS.  \nThe history of NUS is intertwined with the history of Singapore from the time of British colonial rule to WWII, to the tumultuous period before independence and to the modern period with important contributions to the nation's growth. \n\nThis is the story of NUS. \n\nThe arts exhibition should be moved to the National Arts Gallery (that's just my personal opinion) and this \"NUS Museum\" should rightly focus on the history of NUS."

He is one of my most respected and adored \"idols\".\n\nIt has been about 7 years since my last visit here - Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall (Â≠ô‰∏≠Â±±ÂçóÊ¥ãÁ∫™ÂøµÈ¶ÜÔºåÂèàÁß∞ÊôöÊô¥Âõ≠). \n\nThe two storey colonial styled villa has a nice garden and is peaceful and although it's much smaller in size than other museums, it has quite a good collection on Dr Sun and the early history of Singapore, especially about the Chinese communities then.\n\nThe exhibits are interesting and insightful, with digital and interactive platforms to bring the history \"live\".\n\nDr Sun, the great revolutionary leader against the Qing dynasty who overthrew the government after 11th uprising attempt in Wuhan and formed the modern Republic of China (‰∏≠ÂçéÊ∞ëÂõΩ), had his ideologies left a great impression in me. They were Â§©‰∏ã‰∏∫ÂÖ¨ and ‰∏âÊ∞ë‰∏ª‰πâ!\n\nThe world belongs to everyone and not just for the few elites. And if everyone is being treated equally, justly and fairly and everything is done in accordance to the law and order, the world will be a better, more peaceful and stable place to live in.\n\nIt is good to be back here for a revisitation, the place Dr Sun had stayed during his visits to Singapore and immersed in the rich, diversity and colourful history and legacy of Dr Sun! \n\nThere's also a portion of Singapore's history too, mainly about the Chinese communities during the Sino-war, Japanese occupation etc.\n\nThe museum is closed on Mondays and admission is free for Singaporeans and $8 for tourists.\n\n#sglife #sginstagram #exploresg #sg #love #exploresingapore #historic #instagramsg #instasg #historical #singaporetravel #singapore #singaporeinsiders #sginfluencer #weekendfun #vscocam #sysnmh #museum #MuseumVisit #museumcollection #history #photography #travel #museo #exhibition #culture #photooftheday #museums #photo #travelphotography\n\n@zfy_ed84"

Everything is well displayed with simple descriptions attached and some are coupled with good usage of multi media aids which bring the viewing and whole visit a joy. \nHighly recommended to anyone that wants to learn more of Singapore‚Äôs role in the ending China‚Äôs Qing dynasty rule. \nTip for those that drive, so parked either at the residential car park nearby or the mall the opposite. There are no parking on site."

It is free admission for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents. \n\nThe exterior grounds of this colonial style villa is very well-maintained with manicured lawn, commemorative sculptures and a spectacular bronze sculpted mural wall depicting the history of Nanyang (now known as Singapore). \n\nThere are more exhibits to see inside the museum, from old pictures and write-outs of Dr Sun Yat Sen and his fellow comrades, Chinese newspapers, printers to traditional footwear, cheongsam and even furniture. Definitely a must-visit for all who love history, especially families with children and teenagers to learn from history. \n"

I m surprised at how small the \"shoes\" are, similar to my fist size . Other things on the rebel leader which is also interesting (bedroom etc), a bit of his history, n others who supported him ..\n\nThe environment is soothing. Took quite a bit of  photos .

Founded in 1993 and in its present building by the Singapore River since 2003, the museum traces its roots to the Raffles Museum, founded in the middle of the 19th century. ACM focuses on the many historical connections between the cultures of Asia, and between Asia and the world. Singapore‚Äôs history as a port city that brought people together from all over the world is used as a means of examining the history of Asia. Special exhibitions bring magnificent objects from around the world to our Singapore audience. Programmes like the annual River Nights encourage visitors to connect more closely with culture and the arts.",

The temporary exhibition was photography of the tribes of the Amazon and was superb. The real high point though was the chicken curry in the cafe which was absolutely excellent!"

      "description": "With a history dating back to its inception in 1887, the National Museum of Singapore is the nation's oldest museum with a progressive mind. Its galleries adopt cutting-edge and multi-perspective ways of presenting history and culture to redefine conventional museum experience. A cultural and architectural landmark in Singapore, the Museum hosts innovative festivals and events all year round-the dynamic Night Festival, visually arresting art installations, as well as amazing performances and film screenings-in addition to presenting thought-provoking exhibitions involving critically important collections of artefacts. The programming is supported by a wide range of facilities and services including F&B, retail and a Resource Centre. The National Museum of Singapore re-opened in December 2006 after a three-year redevelopment, and celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2012. The Museum refreshed its permanent galleries and re-opened them on 19 September 2015 for Singapore's Golden Jubilee.",

As it is located away from the main road, we arrived to an empty park and we came across 4 couples during our 1-hour visit. The tranquility suits the venue.\n\nSignages in English and Mandarin explain the memorials and shrines. They are interesting to understand the early history of Japanese community in Singapore. Some of the memorials and descriptions are poignant in that they explain the sacrifices and hardship of Japanese settlers and residents in Singapore. It is helpful to refer to Wikipedia's write-up on the Japanese Cemetery Park to better understand the memorials and graves of notable Japanese individuals.\n\nA worthwhile visit and time spent."

We got a tray and filled it with food. Then we went to the cashier to get it weighed. It costs $3.60 per 100gm.  We can take as much or as little as we want.  Brown rice, white rice and porridge are free. So are the drinks and fruit.  It‚Äôs a great idea because there was no waste.  Everyone was bringing their leftovers home.

The narrative seems historically well balanced and the British surrender was signed in this very building which I hadn‚Äôt realised. There‚Äôs a lot to take in here, so bring your reading glasses! In fact, it‚Äôs a more reading-intensive display than many museums, so perhaps better suited to adults and older children than the very young. It‚Äôs also quite a remote location and there‚Äôs no refreshments beyond a water fountain, so be prepared for that. Staff kindly telephoned a taxi for us when we left, since we didn‚Äôt want to use roaming data to get a Grab. At just $7 each to enter, this is great value and much recommended."

Photo taking was not allowed here. They had beads for sale. \n\nThe monks were preparing for a prayer service when we were there. You have to make reservations for a kneeling bench spot to be part of the prayers. As they were closing, we didn‚Äôt have time to visit the roof top garden or the museums on the other floors. Yes, it‚Äôs worth a visit. The energy was very good here in here."

We also visited level 4 with lots of relics, but felt that was less interesting to visitors.\nThe disabled will have no problems, there‚Äôs step free access, and lifts between floors, although I don‚Äôt think you can visit the roof garden without climbing stairs.\nLike many famous places of worship, it‚Äôs swamped by visitors, so don‚Äôt expect to see many paying their respects to the Buddha. We did see several meditating, but to see Buddhism at its best, you‚Äôll need to visit another temple.\nOverall, this is a splendid place to visit when you‚Äôre in Singapore."

There are detailed models of various public housing projects of note in Singapore.  I got a free guided tour, although it was suited for hard-core architects.  On the second floor are galleries showing the history of Singapore.  Honestly I thought these were much more informative and better presented than even the National Museum.  At the end is a scale model of Singapore down to every building on the island.  Plus, there are lines denoting the planned expansion by reclaiming land from the sea.  It's fascinating and I think the best museum in the country."

      "description": "Singapore City Gallery is a great starting point to get to know the city for free. Located beside the Maxwell food centre in the historic district of Chinatown, this 3 storey visitor centre goes beneath the skin of the city to understand how the city came to be, that even though it‚Äôs a dense built-up city of tar, glass and concrete, it is still so green, has memorable buildings, historic districts and walkable streets. You can imagine and design your own version of Marina Bay or explore plans long into the future like Greater Southern Waterfront city. The main draw is an enormous model replica of the City Centre with uncannily accurate miniatures of building and streetscapes. Look out for an illustrative map drawn by Lee Xin Li. It will sure to bring back memories of Singapore, past and present. Before you leave, catch the dramatic 3-min Island Wide Model show screened every 20 mins at level 1.",

It is out by the Singapore Airport, next to the forbidding bulk of Changi Prison.  The Museum is a gallery wrapped around the very simple, and moving, chapel which served Christians and Jews.  Great thanks to the many Australian contributors, who recorded the life of a  large group of young Australians interned. The map of the site shows there was a Women's camp, and the Indian Army Camp, which deserve their own galleries. \nThe numbers who passed through, and the numbers who never returned from work camps outside Singapore, are sobering. \nI was surprised at the amount of creativity the place unleashed in its  population. 'Changi University', the skills taught to inmates by inmates; music, the visual arts; the diaries and the poetry. \nIn the chapel space there is a wall where you can leave your comments on your visit. The reference to how Japanese record their wishes, when visiting their temples, is unmistakable."

As part of the revamp, the National Museum of Singapore which manages Changi Museum has been collecting stories and personal objects from families of former internees that emphasise their personal experiences. The museum‚Äôs narrative is centred on remembrance and reflection, encouraging visitors to contemplate both the hardships that the internees underwent, as well as their courage and resilience in the face of difficulties.",

Despite how a little boring and cold the displays appear, you gotta admit, they have lots of REAL unique antique toys AND memorabilia in there.\n\nThough it is also good to note that - the sensitive, new-age folks might find some exhibits offensive (e.g. there's quite a lot of erm......... African and Chinese toys from that era, and from that perspective). But we love history and culture, and we get that every era's got their thing. \n\nPerhaps they don't just need a new theatre/show - but better storytellers/marketers with fresh eyes to draw in and to remind visitors, that it is okay to look and learn from the past, in order to know how to navigate the present/future better. Maybe not so much of, \"Keep Calm and Carry On\" but rather, \"Let's have a conversation and learn together\" kinda messaging to make it an overall more meaningful and engaging experience for visitors.\n\nJust a Penny (or Farthing) worth of thoughts."

We bought discounted tickets at $30 each (instead of $35) and still not worth it. Museum is quite small and does not take too long to walk through. Recommend they consider halving their prices to get more people in. The upside was we had the whole place (all 5 narrow floors) to ourselves."

I have been to a few toy museums, and this is easily the best laid-out and organized toy museum I personally have seen.\n\nThey have some amazing exhibits organized by subjects.\nA few of my favorites: Astroboy, Ultraman, a really old Batman collection, a newer Darth Maul, barbies, Daleks, and even Sesame Street.  What I appreciated is been able to see some toys that would not be necessarily exhibited elsewhere, like Nazi toys.\n\nTo my understanding, this is only a very small percentage of the total amount of toys that are available to be exhibited.  They have an actual museum curator who actually preserves and categorizes the pieces.  \n\nFor anyone that appreciates toys from their childhood, this place is a must-visit.  \n\nIf there is a day when we are back in Singapore, I will be visiting this museum again."

Many people from different countries are visiting the place there should be a variety of global fast food restaurant, but there is not, also the drinks should be better and have vriety but all the of them sell the same juice every where there. Also one show at water world i missed it some years ago as the last show was at 3 pm, and last week this side was closed for maintenance which was disappointing. They need to have more seating areas with air condition so people can rest in between as the weather is so hot. The experience was overall good but a lot of dissappointments here and there."

          "text": "Review of the Science Centre Singapore, Jurong East, Singapore\nIt was a first visit for the two of us ‚Äì in Singapore for the week ‚Äì but our wards for the day (three primary school-age kids) had been before and were particularly keen to runaround in the kid‚Äôs water park to one side of the main building. For us this was best mid-afternoon and after 3-4 hours of exploring the complex and multi-disciplinary exhibits available that challenged the more inquisitive (and particularly those STEM kids of secondary school age plus).\n\nHow could you not appreciate the planning, design and investment that had been made during almost 50 years that have evolved into the modern-day Science Centre. This is Singapore conceptualizing the country/people into the future ‚Äì challenging those new generations of kids that are always coming through.\n\nFocusing on play, exhibition and knowledge-sharing the Centre provides a mix of demonstrations, print information/wallboards/notices, self-challenges and more that apply to adults and kids alike in more than a couple of dozen separate exhibition-focused sub-centres. Whether exploring the visual images of you and your fellow travellers in the maze of mirrors (wherein you‚Äôre provided with a short plastic tube that you hold in front of you to prevent you  turning into your own reflection); exploring your personal phobias/fears (you being buried alive, you addressing a public meeting, your phobias ‚Äì ghosts, insects, reptiles, tunnels, school, etc.); and many, many more ‚Äì to numerous to cover here.\n\nYou and your personal waste was a novel focus - this is you understanding what happens to the food that you eat, how/where you process it internally and, crucially, how you excrete those parts that are of little/no value to you. Therein is focus upon those familiar bodily functions in language/diagrams that are easy to follow. In a word or two ‚Ä¶ how much do you understand ‚ÄòPoo‚Äô at both personal and public level? You may be surprised of just how little most of us know about the reality/mechanics of poo (inside and outside the body).\n\nAt key times during the day the Centre offered public demonstrations of ‚Äòfire‚Äô and ‚Äòelectricity.‚Äô This came within well-established/protected equipment/environments that began with a brief synopsis of the concepts involved, followed by the security issues that apply (i.e. the personal risks that apply to public demonstrations of his kind, and requirements for crowd control/escape should unexpected risks/issues arise). We were informed that electrical discharge across open space exemplifies lightning and/or those historical scientific R&D investigations that, 200 years later, may seem novel/dangerous to us ‚Äì but which have enabled the modern world to understand, apply and implement programs that currently suggest that solar power as a source of energy/electricity will eventually come to dominate human development everywhere (and, subsequently, help stabilize and/or reverse global climate warming).\n\nSo, our visit helped confirm the raison d'etre of the Science Centre, but it also re-confirmed that you‚Äôd need to make several visits to explore the entire range of focuses, sub-centres, concepts, entertainment and more available. We just ran out of time, etc. and completely by-passed Tinkering, Climate Change, Earth Alive, Embracing Ageing, Light Fantastic, Mind‚Äôs Eye, Laser Maze, Ecogarden, Kinetic Garden, etc. What we did capture, however, was the full extent of the delightful play available in Waterworks ‚Äì the kid‚Äôs water park ‚Äì the highlight of our visit.\n\nThe water exhibits may have helped stimulate those young brains, but it was the joie de vivre of the kids in the pleasure of running around in the water pools, showers, jets, curtains and falling water that really came across well. The actual science, of course, was entirely beyond them - how much water can you personally support in tubes; how the clock in the tower also records wind direction/velocity and rainfall; how rainbows are formed, etc.\n\nIt should also be said that the design/concept of the original R&D water facilities reflect an investment made 40-50 years ago ‚Äì and they looked tired; many appeared defunct and/or were no longer working ‚Äì the rainbow/umbrella/compass, the twin water buckets at the top of the clock tower (which no longer filled/tipped ‚Äì and presumably powered the clock), etc. Whatever, it was all well-over the heads of our three youngsters who would rather be playing on the large seesaw (which dunked them in the water each cycle) than explore the science available (or, the reality, not available). All great fun then.\n\nAnd it‚Äôs not enough to appreciate the Science Centre of the day, but to note that a new one is in the pipeline (as reported for 2027). It‚Äôs destined to be next to the existing Centre and will comprise five inter-locking rectangular buildings over-looking Jurong Lake. If this date is met it will represent the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Centre. Well done everyone.\n\nAnd here‚Äôs some user-experience worth noting ‚Ä¶ travel by MRT to Jurong East station and then walk to Centre. Follow Google maps? Sure, easy ‚Ä¶ easy it was not. Building development around the station/neighbourhood was/is challenging. There were no signs directing those on foot. Mind you, it sets you up for the Science Centre. That was confusing too.\n\nPeter Steele\n06 November 2024"

Our favourite was the lightening show at 12pm, the scary spooky house and the mirror maze. \n\nThey do have a water play section, so I recommend to pack bathers for the kids if they want to get wet after. Upon exit is a huge shop with lots of science kits and science goodies if you want to continue the science fun at home."

My two kids were first unsure how it would turn out to be, they started complaining that it was too childish for them (aged 12 and 15)  and gradually as they kept discovering all these creative and educational exhibits with a fun twist to them, they were in awe and didn't want to leave! However we also visited the Omni theatre and that was a huge disappointment. Not worth the money. The technology is in place but the movie options were hopeless - not at all entertainment in any kind."

Names of significant people in the community, their efforts and donations are also etched on the walls. It's free, visitors are welcome and the young lady customer service officer was most gracious and helpful.\nA nice little unexpected find in the quietness of Covid times when the streets and stalls aren't well-patronized or fully functioning."

Most of the elements that had given the garden its character are gone - the Karezansui dry garden at the entrance now just looks like a random pile of rocks, there is no more cloud pruning, most of the red bridges have been removed, the beautiful stone lantern valley is gone, the Kusari-doi rain chain is gone, etc. The garden just looks like any other park in Singapore. Why still call it a Japanese garden if it no longer reflects that culture and tradition? There are also numerous signs around the garden informing visitors of the science behind various aspects of the garden. That's all very well, but how about some culture as well?"

Entry is free. There is another gate near the water lily pond which is nearer to Jurong Bus Interchange.

The sea even though it is full of shipping tankers, it is still just wonderful to look out to the vast expanse of the ocean. It is so calming. We spend a relaxing while just watching the sea  before continuing our walk. There is a lot of natural bushland as well with warnings about native monkeys. We did not see any. Just lots of happy Singaporeans enjoying the park.\n\nIf you are in the area of Marine Parade or nearby do drop by for an hour or two. You will enjoy it. There is even a Starbucks for some take away coffee while you enjoy the scenery."

After around 20 minutes walking you come to small beach with bbq facilities and toilets /shower facilities.

      "description": "Fort Canning Park is one of Singapore's most historic landmarks. It has witnessed Singapore's golden age, when Malay Kings ruled from its peak, and watched as the island transformed from a sleepy fishing village into a vibrant trading hub in the 19th century. During World War II, the hill was instrumental in Singapore's war efforts with numerous military buildings located there. One of these buildings was the Fort Canning Bunker or Battle Box, where the decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese was made by the British. Many war relics from Singapore's colourful history have survived on the hill and are still visible today.Although the hill has since lost its imposing stature, its distinctive charm still remains. The lush lawns draw picnics, concerts, theatre productions and festivals, while weddings, parties and gatherings are a regular sight in the park's elegant indoor function rooms. Visit the park today and experience the tranquillity once enjoyed by the Malay royals of yore.",

The pier is located v near Marina South Pier mrt. \n\nWe bought the ferry tickets through klook with a discount n gong char voucher. Definitely worth the deal. The ferry is almost full at the 9am departure.  We follow the itinerary and visit st John Island as first stop for about 15-20 mins n then took the nxt ferry to Kusu Island.\n\nThere was a fire few months ago at the Hindu temple up the hills but the stairs was cordoned off on day of visit. \n\nThe Chinese temple was not crowded n looks well maintained.  We pray n make donations. The potted plants in the temple are beautiful. Not much people at the temple. We enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere, many sparrows, trees  waves, breezes.... away from the üò† city life.\n\nYou need to bring your own food n water if u going to visit these islands."

It was opened in 1970 and a visit to Jurong Hill Park feels like a step back in time.  It definitely reminded me of my younger days when a visit here was combined with a visit to the Jurong Bird Park which is next to it on the western side of the hill.\nThe road leading to the park has a gentle incline with lots of greenery.  Especially outstanding is the large bush of Simpoh Air with its freshly bloomed yellow flowers.\nAt the first level , there are the carpark,  toilet facilities and a small landscaped garden with plants such as poinsettia.  There used to be a restaurant here at this level but it is now closed.  \nThe Look Out Tower  can be reached by  another flight of stairs up to the higher level or a walk up the slope to get to it.  Beside the Look Out Tower is the Garden of Fame with 30 trees planted by foreign dignitaries and heads of states from 1969 to 1984.\n\nThe first tree was planted by Princess Alexandra of the United Kingdom in 1969 and the last tree was planted by Singapore‚Äôs economic advisor Dr Albert Winsemius in 1984.\n\nOthers who have planted trees here include Queen Elizabeth II, Deng Xiaoping and Singapore‚Äôs President Benjamin Sheares. The plaques at the base of each tree provide informations on the VIP and the dates of their visit.  There is also another newer Garden of Fame on the grounds of Jurong Town Hall as the space on Jurong Hill Park ran out.\n\nThe Look Out Tower  has broad ramps which spiral three levels upwards.  The top of the Look Out Tower has decorative stained glass set into the ceiling.\nAs we went up the ramps,  the view of Jurong Island in the distance unfolded.  We also saw unique fern-like trees with markings on its trunks which resemble lips.  \n\nWe took bus 194 from Boon Lay Interchange to get here.  The bus was an express one and we alighted at the first stop along Jalan Ahmad Abrahim.  Alternatively one can walk along the Jurong Park Connector from Jurong Central Park (opposite to Boon Lay Mrt Station) to get here.\nWe actually visited here after exploring the Raffles Marina Lighthouse next to the Tuas Link Mrt Station in the morning. We packed our lunch from Jurong Point and had a mini picnic at Jurong Hill Park.  It was a lovely visit exploring the gem spots in  industrial Jurong."

          "text": "I stayed near Stirling Road and Hort Park is just around the corner from Alexandra Hospital and is at one end of the Alexandra Arch Bridge.  This is the third time I came here. The first time I dropped by here when I intend to take the forest walk to Henderson Waves. The second time, I passed by this park while on my way to explore Kent Ridge Park. I did not spend much time here during the last two occasions and it was just touch and go. But this time I stayed longer for about 2 hours. \n\nThe Visitor Centre was closed as today is a public holiday.  Unlike the previous occasions where I witnessed wedding ceremony held at the viewing platform and sumptuous banquet at the Vineyard restaurant, there was no wedding this time. It was quiet and missed the opportunity to see the pretty charming faces of the brides. \n\nI walked down to the Canopy restaurant at the ground floor and there was a crowd of patrons having their late breakfast or brunch. The restaurant looks unique with plants hanging down from the ceiling and decorative potted plants studded around the corners.  I would come to patronise this restaurant one day with my family and to see if their culinary art is good. There was a shop selling plants and gardening accessories in front of the restaurant and if you want to learn on how to build your own pot, you can consult them daily from 10 am to 7 pm daily. I understand that it is free. \n\nI walked further down to the Balinese Garden; the Edible Garden, the Therapeutic Garden, the Allotment Garden, the Butterfly Garden, the Medicine Garden, the Orchid Garden, the Nature playground, etc. I particularly like the Edible Garden and the Allotment Garden as they give me ideas on the type of the vegetables that I can grow at my balcony.  I went around to browse at all the edible plants I know and I saw ladyfinger plants, the mini brinjal, papaya, sweet potato leaves. aloe vera. The strong fragrance of Pandan leaves pervaded the atmosphere as I rooamed at the Edible Garden.  \n\nI spoke to someone at the Allotment Garden who was seen cutting the sweet potato leaves that she harvested and she commented that diligence is imperative in caring for the plants otherwise it would overgrown or eaten by worms. \n\nI love the different colourful species of orchid plants in the Orchid Garden but lamented not knowing much of the plants in the Medicine Garden. It would be ideal if Nparks can assign someone to station at the respective gardens to explain on the type of plants and how to grow them or provide complimentary seeds to those who are interested. \n\nThis Hort Park is very suitable for family outing especially for those with young kids. There are few playgrounds for children to enjoy. And this time, I saw a number of families brought their kids here to enjoy nature. The Nature Playground which is meant for kids fascinated me.  It is good to inculcate in the young the love for nature. As I walk around the nature playground, the bee-hive box, the sound of the cicada and the whistling birds flooded my ears. The butterflies fluttering past me and suddenly a squirrel would dash out from no where up the tree. It would be real fun for kids to experience what is nature when most are brought up in the concrete jungle. \n\nA Garden is a delight to the eye and a solace for the soul. I am not a Zen master but after walking here for an hour plus, I felt relieved and my mind turned out to be more  calmer and less tense. \n\n"

On the slope going down to the garden from the lobby, I was happy to see to uncommon creepers, the Silky Afgekia and the Elephant Creeper.  I also enjoyed learning that Globe Amaranth is an edible plant grown in the Edible Garden together with the orange Cosmos flowers.\nAnother interesting feature is the various trees with roads named after them.  All these informations are well explained on the sign board next to the trees.  I learned that there are Kasai Road and Saraca Road in Singapore.  In fact the nearby roads there are all named after plants and trees.  Athough the orchid enclosure is a small area, we were pleasantly surprised to find the name of an orchid which we having been searching for.  Children are well entertained here with the playground and the native garden."

Relax by the reservoir / pond. Nice to rest a while. Note exiting the park by the rear involves a steep walk - you have been warned.

      "description": "Cruising since 1987. For more than a decade and a half, bumboats have been plying the Singapore River. The story of Singapore River Cruise begins in 1987. The \"Clean Rivers Campaign\" of 1983 saw the relocation of bumboats to Pasir Panjang. The familiar painted faces of our Bumboats were due to disappear from its home, until SRC was awarded the tender license to run river services here - the first also, to operate such services along the river. We are entering a new chapter in the Singapore River story. In this modern age, Bumboats on this historic waterway remind us of its rustic charm. SRC has been preserving the heritage of this important river for more than two decades. Its bumboats have become the icon of our river to visitors and locals alike. 2008 was a year when our iconic bumboats underwent a transformation. The diesel-powered engines of SRC's fleet made way for a new generation of electric ones that boast quieter engines and zero CO2 emissions. These are the very boats that operate along the Singapore River today. SRC is committed to greater excellence. Under its strong management, the company has developed a firm network of channel intermediaries from government agencies, embassies, event organizers and other operators in the tourism sector, both local and overseas. From a humble fleet of 4 bumboats in 1987, SRC has since increased its number to 24 today with a few new additions coming onboard soon.",

Many people from different countries are visiting the place there should be a variety of global fast food restaurant, but there is not, also the drinks should be better and have vriety but all the of them sell the same juice every where there. Also one show at water world i missed it some years ago as the last show was at 3 pm, and last week this side was closed for maintenance which was disappointing. They need to have more seating areas with air condition so people can rest in between as the weather is so hot. The experience was overall good but a lot of dissappointments here and there."

This still did not stop us from buying up lots of little presents. \n\nWe even found a place to sit down and have some lunch. A visit to Chinatown should be a must and it is well worth the crowds to get those bargains."

Photo taking was not allowed here. They had beads for sale. \n\nThe monks were preparing for a prayer service when we were there. You have to make reservations for a kneeling bench spot to be part of the prayers. As they were closing, we didn‚Äôt have time to visit the roof top garden or the museums on the other floors.

We also visited level 4 with lots of relics, but felt that was less interesting to visitors.\nThe disabled will have no problems, there‚Äôs step free access, and lifts between floors, although I don‚Äôt think you can visit the roof garden without climbing stairs.\nLike many famous places of worship, it‚Äôs swamped by visitors, so don‚Äôt expect to see many paying their respects to the Buddha. We did see several meditating, but to see Buddhism at its best, you‚Äôll need to visit another temple.\nOverall, this is a splendid place to visit when you‚Äôre in Singapore."

It was so peaceful with just the noise of the cicadas and birds and I also had a close encounter with a monitor lizard who sat on the boardwalk on my journey into the park. At the waterfront I headed first along the new Bukit Chermin Boardwalk towards Keppel Bay and the impressive Reflections condominions. After a short walk in that direction I headed back and then walked into Labrador Park, to the Dragons Teeth Gate and the Berlayer Beacon. I walked the path towards the playground and the jetty before heading into the hilly and wooden area that hides a number of wartime tributes, passing the Fourth Gun Position, the 1892 Storeroom and checked out the Gunners of Labrador Battery Tribute.\n\nIt was a really lovely way to spend a few hours and although I didn't see too much wildlife (apart from the monitor lizard and plenty of chickens) it was so peaceful and there was just nobody around. A perfect break away from the hustle and bustle of the city itself."

I entered the nature reserve via the Berlayer Creek mangrove trail. The environment was peaceful and calm. At the look-out point, I sat down to appreciate the sapphire sea water that came in to nourish the mangrove roots. The heavy buzzing of the cicada sound like little alarm welcoming me to the rustic greenery on both sides of the board walk.\n\nIt was breezy taking the coastal walk to the park and I like to hear the rhematic splashing of the sea water against the rocky bank.¬† From the jetty, I walked my way to the fort area. As I walked up the slope, I saw the site where the British erected the gunnery and the artillery to prevent a naval attack at the southern harbor. The British constructed the most impregnable fortress to guard against intrusions but during the Second World War, the Japanese attacked Singapore from the northern coast instead of the southern coast. The defense strategy did not work, and Singapore lost to the Japanese within a week of fighting. ¬†\n¬†\nThis part of the nature reserve is rather quiet and covered by dense vegetation. I took about an hour to roam around and walked my way to the top and then back to the park. I took the same way out by taking a return walk along the Berlayer Creek. ¬†\n\nWhile walking home, I pondered: would Singapore has fallen if the Japanese would attack from the south instead of from the north?¬†"

One way is along the Berlayer Creek Boardwalk which is a 1km trek through the jungle and following a river. Alas we did not see any wildlife except for squirrels. Another way to access the park will be via a boardwalk from Harbourfront but this was under construction when we visited."

          "text": "I had been to this nature reserve on a number of occasions with my residents and friends. However, this was the first time I came alone. It started to drizzle when I reached this nature reserve. The right extreme corner of the waterfront was seen barricaded due to a fallen tree caused probably by the heavy rain on the previous night.  \n\nAs I strolled towards the other corner of the waterfront promenade, the rain started to pour heavily.  All the visitors rushed to seek shelter and the promenade look deserted. The atmosphere suddenly became so quiet and calm.  It was a beautiful sensation engaging in a solitary walk along this promenade. It was a pleasure listening to the rhythm of the rain with the splashing sound  of the strong seawaves hitting against the concrete bank at the background. Occasionally, I could hear the momentary dim horning from the distant vessels berth at the anchorage.  \n\nAs I reached the Dragon's teeth Gate or Batu Berlayer area, I remember that this was once a historical pirate hide-out. The British colonialist Admiral Henry Keppel was determined to eradicate them so as to build a strataegic port here. That was history and the gun post did not fascinate me much as I continued my way along the Bukit Chermin Boardwalk. From the jetty, I could view and admire the iconic and elegant architectural design of Reflections at Keppel Bay condo standing tall from a distance.  \n\nThe boardwalk is unique as one has the opportunity to appreciate the mangrove swamp as the boardwalk cut through the mangrove swamp.  I was surprised to see the gigantically thick roots of some of the mangrove trees on the swamp. Then, at the end of the boardwalk, I returned to the Labrador MRT station where I earlier started by journey. \n\n I had a book `An Amazing Rebirth' by Maria Chan Rhomberg with me during the journey.  Her approach to life's impermanence and life's adversity are `Seeing things as they are' and `Letting Go'. Learn to relax and take long walks, paying attention to the natural beauty around you.  And I learn to listen to the rhythm of the rain and appreciate the beauty of the sea horizon."

My husband and I had just about wrapped up our visit to the wonderful cloud forest but we were still clueless on navigating outside the gardens. It was right as we were leaving when we approached a guide, Hazik, who at first seemed at a rush with his clipboard in hand but stopped all he was doing to assist us. He not only kindly explained the directions we requested but started an insightful conversation and even assisted in planning out a detailed itinerary for our brief stay in Singapur. We would like to extend our gratitude for his kindness and patience in guiding us which ultimately was the highlight of our trip to the gardens!"

My time in the city was limited, but I still ended up spending basically one entire day roaming the grounds and exploring the different facilities (e.g. Flower Dome, Supertree Grove, Cloud Forest). Tickets are available at various entry points for any or all areas you‚Äôd like to see, which, for me, was everything. The cost is pricey but 1000% worth the investment. Multiple food vendors are on the premises. Nearby GBTB (abbreviated name) are Marina Bay Sands (the hotel/casino/shopping mall) and the waterfront promenade, plus a metro station (Bayfront MRT) is connected to everything so one needn‚Äôt walk outdoors too much if hot and humid."

Bring your money to the casino (no ATMs in the casino, ask me how I know :)\n3. If taking the MRT (Singapore's subway - which is amazing BTW), go to the Marina Bay stop and follow the signs for the casino - very easy.\n4. A player's card is required if you're cashing out more than 4000 dollars - so might as well get a player's card as you enter the casino - it's easy - just go to the Sands Player's Club desk.\n5. The table games (we played Texas Hold 'Em and 3 Card Poker) are generally $25 and $50.  The slots were generally 2 cents and above, though we did find penny slots.\n6. There was no tax on our winnings of $5k from a slot machine.\n7.  A beer was $10.  Water and soft drinks are free.  The service is great!\n8.  Non-smoking area on the second floor.\n\nEnjoy your time, we thought it was a great place!"

          "text": "Marina Bay Sands Casino in Singapore\n\nI visited the Marina Bay Sands (MBS) Casino in Singapore from December 9-10. This standalone casino, part of the MBS resort, is one of the world's most expensive, costing over $7 billion USD to build.\nFirst Impressions The casino is enormous, spanning four floors. The check-in process was stringent but fair, likely due to the high-security measures in place to ensure the safety of all guests. While some reviews have criticized this process, I found it acceptable given the importance of security. Foreign guests and Singapore residents have separate lines for entry.\nCasino Experience The casino boasts approximately 700 table games and over 1,400 slot machines. The starting bets for table games were higher than what I am accustomed to in Europe. I tried my luck on the slot machine \"All Aboard\" with a low bet and was fortunate to leave the casino with a win on both days. It's no secret that the odds are against you in the long run, so I quit early to secure my profits. Regardless of winning or losing, it was a pleasant experience and a highlight of my holiday.\n\nPositives\n‚Ä¢\tLarge casino with hundreds of tables and thousands of slot machines.\n‚Ä¢\tGood atmosphere with plenty of options for gaming.\n‚Ä¢\tEasy to spend several hours here.\n‚Ä¢\tGood membership and rewards program.\n\nNegatives\n‚Ä¢\tSmoking in public places is allowed, which I hope will be banned in the future.\n‚Ä¢\tUnlike in Europe, food and drinks are not complimentary.\n‚Ä¢\tThe winning rate is reportedly low, making it challenging to beat the slots and table games.\n\nOverall, the Marina Bay Sands Casino offers a unique and enjoyable experience, despite a few drawbacks."

A 30 minute Grab from Downtown takes you to Changi Ferry terminal from where boats leave regularly, as long as at least 10 people are waiting. Fare is S$4 each way, cash only. In fact almost everything on the island is cash and there are no ATMs, so come prepared. On arrival up the jetty and turn left for the bike hire places. We went to No 45 and got three fairly ancient BMX style bikes for $30 in total. Some bikes have baskets, but no suggestion of helmets, padlock, etc. We then cycled east, along the nice sensory trail to the entrance to the Wetlands. About 3-4 km. It‚Äôs well shaded, well way marked and with a few short slight inclines. I‚Äôd have thought anyone with modest fitness will find it easy, but don‚Äôt forget to bring water. The Wetlands entrance has an obligatory parking place for bikes, toilets, drink vending machine and some info. Two flat trails take you past mangroves then over the sea on raised decking. It‚Äôs free. We saw otters, two troops on monkeys, monitors and other lizards. Loads of butterflies and birds.\nOverall really enjoying day and a nice change."

          "text": "(This review is about a bike rental kiosk on Ubin, not about Chek Jawa. It doesn‚Äôt have its own TripAdvisor page, and many people get to Chek Jawa by cycling. My 5 stars are for Chek Jawa; 1 star for this bike kiosk.)\n\nIf you plan to rent a bike to cycle to Chek Jawa, for your own safety avoid renting from the first bicycle kiosk you see when walking in from the jetty. (It is on the right and it‚Äôs called Comfort Bicycle Rental & Trading, although this name is not prominently displayed. Shop no 18 ‚Äì there‚Äôs a few bike kiosks close to each other. Photos included.) Most people rent from here because it‚Äôs the first bicycle kiosk they see and because its staff are quite proactive in inviting passersby to rent from them. But their bicycles are poorly maintained and if you run into trouble, you‚Äôre unlikely to get any help from their customer service.\n\nMy front tyre started losing air and then came completely off its rim when I was cycling (photos included). I believe this was due to a tyre that was punctured before I rented it, because when I took it that morning I noticed the front wheel was already soft (so I asked a staff member to inflate it before I took it). When I got back to the kiosk, I asked them to refund my bike rental and the cost of the shuttle van that I had to charter to bring me and the bike back to the jetty.\n\nThey refused to refund the bike rental, because I could have hit a nail when riding. (I accept that we don‚Äôt know exactly when the tyre got punctured.) But they also refused to refund my shuttle van cost of $10, saying in Chinese that my van rental had ‚Äúnothing to do with them‚Äù and suggesting that I could have left my bike on the trail and walked back to the jetty instead. (I was stranded near Ah Ma's Drinks Stall on the way back from Puaka Hill, so I believe walking back would have taken me at least 30-45min.) When I insisted, they told me that they were already charging me a low rate for the bicycle ($12 per day) compared to the bicycle kiosks in East Coast Park, and that bicycle parts and maintenance were expensive. \n\nI told them that when my tyre came off, I had twice called the phone number on their receipt for help, but no one picked up. They said no one was attending to the phone because they were busy, but even then they would only have sent a shuttle van to pick me up ‚Äì seemingly implying that they would still have charged me for the van. After about five to ten minutes of heated conversation, they finally agreed to give me half the van‚Äôs cost ‚Äúto be fair, although we won‚Äôt do this for other people‚Äù.\n\nWhile their demeanour was very unpleasant, I‚Äôm less concerned about not getting the van‚Äôs cost refunded, and more so about their lack of interest in how the accident happened. I believe the tyre was already punctured because the front wheel was already soft when I rented it (as mentioned earlier) but also because earlier that day I had to try four different bikes before I found one that was working:\n1.\tThe first bicycle‚Äôs chain had come off. \n2.\tThe second‚Äôs back wheel brakes were not very effective (to be fair a staff member helped me to tighten them immediately, but I still wanted to change bike). \n3.\tThe third also had poor back brakes, but when I asked a staff member to help me tighten them, he said that this bicycle‚Äôs brakes were bad and brought out a fourth bike for me to try instead. \n4.\tThis was the bike with the soft front tyre which I eventually took after I asked a staff member to reinflate it. I took it because by this time my friend, who had taken the first bike she tried, had been waiting at least 15 minutes for me to find a bike.\n\nI rented the bikes at 10am on a Saturday, so it‚Äôs more likely that they don‚Äôt maintain their bikes well than that someone had returned them in poor condition. When asking for the bike rental refund I tried to tell them about their poor maintenance ‚Äì how I‚Äôd tried four different bikes in the morning and how my front wheel had already been soft. But they ignored these points and kept saying I must have hit a nail when riding, otherwise the tyre would have deflated much sooner. (I believe it was a slow puncture ‚Äì I managed to cycle to Chek Jawa and partway back, and only noticed the tyre was getting soft when on a detour to Puaka Hill. It came off only after I left Puaka Hill.)\n\nFortunately I was cycling slowly and on flat ground when the tyre came off. I‚Äôm afraid to think what might have happened if the tyre had come off when I was riding fast, downhill, or near other cyclists. Or if a child or an elderly person had ridden this bike. \n\nI won‚Äôt rent from this kiosk again. I‚Äôd recommend walking further into the street, where there‚Äôs at least two to three other bicycle kiosks. In particular, if you walk all the way to the end where the street opens into a clearing, there‚Äôs a standalone bicycle kiosk in a hut on the left, which gets the least business because of its location. I‚Äôll likely try that one the next time I visit Pulau Ubin.\n\nP.S. If renting a bike on Ubin, please check your tyre pressure, brakes and that you can change gears! The last two matter because there are slopes on the way to Chek Jawa."

We were able to check in early & Andy - the receptionist really came through for us! He recognized from my booking that we're celebrating our anniversary so he upgraded us to a suite room, with the same view overlooking the Gardens on 30th floor. OMG, our suite room was spectacular!!! The housekeeping staff was also very efficient and welcoming. Making sure that we're always taken care of as far as stocking our room every time we're gone, the things we used gets replaced & cleaned up. We're glad to spend this much booking this hotel. It's a one in a lifetime experience. The infinity pool was also amazing! I would definitely recommend to everyone to celebrate their special day here at the MBS hotel. Everything is perfect and breathtaking!!!\n\nThe Rise buffet was amazing! We had dinner and very pleased with the food selection and service. Make sure you sign up for Marina Bay Sands app, you get rewards points/cash that you can use to any of their restaurants & stores, just make sure to present your membership number every time you pay. \n\nLastly,  hands up  to Andy at the hotel reception.

We only have to get through 2 different security officers to enter the RWS casino, compared to 4 security check points to enter the MBS casino. The RWS casino also has a proper and genuine smoke-free area for its patrons, which is infinitely better than the MBS casino! We are non-smokers and almost died of smoke inhalation in the MBS casino the night before, therefore this was a welcome respite for us. My Uncle played the roulette tables, I played the slot machines. The is a better variety of slot machines here. Both of us walked away with small winnings after several hours spent here."

We encountered a staff at the entry gate named Sam Liau who was extremely rude and disrespectful.\n\nAs first time visitors, we were new to the process. My parents gave him both passports and in a condescending and rude tone he told them to hold their own passport and he got extremely frustrated when my parents showed him the arrival card but couldn‚Äôt tell him exactly which of the arrival card (both in the same phone) is my mum‚Äôs and which is my dad‚Äôs. He rolled his eyes and rudely tell my parents to get away from the entrance and go back of the queue. This would have been a quick check on the passport number against the arrival card for two persons and there were only one couple queuing behind them. \n\nIt‚Äôs ok to tell my parents to let the couple behind them to go first and to check which arrival card is whose but he could ask in a nice manner. His attitude was appalling treating my elderly parents who are in their late 60s like criminals. His tone of voice/demeanor and his treatment was so harsh that we were shocked. This is a hospitality business and in no way customers should be treated as such that we felt so unwelcoming. It‚Äôs not a fault of visitors to be new to the process nor a fault of elderly to be a bit slow with phones/digital arrival card. I thought the whole point of having a staff there was to help and check?\n\nIt seems like Sam Liau didn‚Äôt want to do the simple job of checking arrival card against passport and didn‚Äôt like his job much. It‚Äôs ok too but don‚Äôt treat customers especially elderly so disrespectfully and take it out on them - the lack of manners is truely shocking. Very bad experience. We won‚Äôt be returning again. We will go to the other casino where we feel more welcomed."

I also found the variety of machines to be a bit better here than at MBS, although still lacking in machine variety when compared to most other casinos worldwide.  The layout of this casino also made the smokiness not nearly as bad as it was at MBS.  And I was satisfied with the inexpensive and easy to locate food outlets.  The gamblers were also not mostly trashy like I found them to be at MBS.  Still not great here, but certainly better than MBS in my view, and quite acceptable if you want to do some machine gambling while in Singapore.  Note though that we only played slots/pokies on this trip/visit and not table games."

You have to be pre-approved in a separate area and then bring proof that you're worthy of entry. \n\n I assume, a credit check or at least a check of my credit card limit was in order.  I passed.

This allowed a full morning to be spent around the gardens, taking in breakfast after a couple of hours and retiring back to our son‚Äôs apartment around lunchtime when it became too hot and humid.\n\nSo much has been written about the gardens, there is no real need to add more except to confirm that they are world class, beautifully maintained by a veritable army of gardeners and, amazingly, apart from the orchid garden, free of charge.  They are a favourite with joggers, dog walkers and, as the morning wears on, organised school visits and crocodiles of tourists.  Busy, but never crowded.\n\nThere is always a lot of wildlife around but on our first visit, we did not see Singapore‚Äôs famous film-star otters.  There was lots of advice from people about where they were yesterday, or their usual routes between ponds, and there were  birds, terrapins and salamanders a-plenty; but no otters.  Maybe, being film stars, their agent only lets them come out for appearance money these days.\n\nThe second visit also started early and my wife decided that it was necessary to ‚Äúdiscuss‚Äù which platform to use at Downtown MRT station to get to the gardens.  (Same as on the previous occasion, one might have thought.)  Naturally, she favoured the ‚Äúother‚Äù one.  By the time the discussion was over, we descended to the platform to see the train vanishing down the tunnel.  No matter, it was only two minutes until the next one.  \n\nHowever, they were an important two minutes.  We strolled into the gardens accompanying the usual joggers and dog walkers who take advantage of the cool dawn period, and as we rounded the corner towards the northernmost pond, we were just in time to see the back legs and tail of an otter slip into the water fifty yards away.  By the time we made that spot, the only trace of otters were about half a dozen tiny bow waves at the other side of the pond heading for the reeds.  If only we had not been held up by the ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù and missed the train!  Oh well; next time we are in Singapore perhaps.\n\nAnyway, it was still a most pleasing morning around the gardens and they remain, even with elusive otters, a ‚Äúmust see‚Äù location in Singapore."

He also showed us the bats, which we would have missed if he had not been there. \nWe walked around through the pods (interesting designs) to the Wetland Centre. Then continued around the loop at the tidal ponds, the Migratory Bird trail. There were not many birds around when we were there. We did not see any crocodiles, but did see numerous monitor lizards.  Few people around too!\nAn interesting day trip to do and worth the effort. Would probably return on another visit to Singapore."

There wasn't many visitors and the place is tranquil.  One has to look up and down and around to spot the wild lives. This is not a zoo so spotting is not guaranteed.  \n\nThe regular visitors and photographers to the Reserve are generally helpful and would alert you to their sightings.\n\nTips:\n1) Take the MRT to Choa Chu Kang Station and transfer to Bus No. 925 to the entrance of the Reserve.  2 minutes walk from the bus stop to the entrance.  \n2) Free entrance.\n3) Close at 7pm.  Advisable to visit in the morning.\n4) Bring water and snacks along.  A binocular would be good."

It was relatively quiet, lots of parking space and just a handful of visitors.\n\nOne of the staff reminded us that the park closed at 7.00pm. Given that we had just about 40 minutes of time to explore this place, we decided to keep to the coastal trail.\n\nThere are pods dotted along the boardwalk which are great lookout points. We visited the Fantail Pod and Eagle Point. Both offered stunning views over Strait of Johor.\n\nWe didn‚Äôt spot any crocodiles or eagles. Will have to come back another time.\n\nWhile there are buses that ply the Kranji MRT Station and Sungei Buloh route, I think it‚Äôs much better to drive there."

I went on the VIP tour, and got a spectacular guide named Ying, who made sure to point out everything she could. \n\nShe was very knowledgeable with answering questions as well. She even tested my understanding by asking me questions back.\n\nSometimes the fish were not cooperative and she was patient to make sure I saw what I needed (we sat and looked for the Tiger Shark for a while). :)\n\nThe dolphin experience was fun, would be more fun if I was 40 years younger. The kids will really love this. Still managed to put me in a good mood when the dolphin laughed with me.\n\nThe behind the scenes tours were great as well, you get to see the hatcheries of the jellyfish and plankton, and even the coral.\n\nAll in all a great value, but Ying made it really memorable!

This allowed a full morning to be spent around the gardens, taking in breakfast after a couple of hours and retiring back to our son‚Äôs apartment around lunchtime when it became too hot and humid.\n\nSo much has been written about the gardens, there is no real need to add more except to confirm that they are world class, beautifully maintained by a veritable army of gardeners and, amazingly, apart from the orchid garden, free of charge.  They are a favourite with joggers, dog walkers and, as the morning wears on, organised school visits and crocodiles of tourists.  Busy, but never crowded.\n\nThere is always a lot of wildlife around but on our first visit, we did not see Singapore‚Äôs famous film-star otters.  There was lots of advice from people about where they were yesterday, or their usual routes between ponds, and there were  birds, terrapins and salamanders a-plenty; but no otters.  Maybe, being film stars, their agent only lets them come out for appearance money these days.\n\nThe second visit also started early and my wife decided that it was necessary to ‚Äúdiscuss‚Äù which platform to use at Downtown MRT station to get to the gardens.  (Same as on the previous occasion, one might have thought.)  Naturally, she favoured the ‚Äúother‚Äù one.  By the time the discussion was over, we descended to the platform to see the train vanishing down the tunnel.  No matter, it was only two minutes until the next one.  \n\nHowever, they were an important two minutes.  We strolled into the gardens accompanying the usual joggers and dog walkers who take advantage of the cool dawn period, and as we rounded the corner towards the northernmost pond, we were just in time to see the back legs and tail of an otter slip into the water fifty yards away.  By the time we made that spot, the only trace of otters were about half a dozen tiny bow waves at the other side of the pond heading for the reeds.  If only we had not been held up by the ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù and missed the train!  Oh well; next time we are in Singapore perhaps.\n\nAnyway, it was still a most pleasing morning around the gardens and they remain, even with elusive otters, a ‚Äúmust see‚Äù location in Singapore."

          "text": "Review of Singapore Zoo\n\nThis was our second visit to Singapore Zoo in two years and we remain as committed to our earlier findings as those of the current day ‚Ä¶. The zoo provides an excellent opportunity to catch a glimpse of the complexity of the natural world that surrounds us. Besides looking at the animals in their protective enclosures there‚Äôs the underlying messages for conservation, value and appreciation that an entertaining day at the zoo provides. It helps to emphasize the unnatural balance of people worldwide within the demand for resources of land, materials, food, water and living space ‚Ä¶ with much the same requirements for the other creatures with which we share the planet.\n\nThe messages are there for those who seek them except it‚Äôs a lot to ask when you‚Äôve a day out with the kids/family and you‚Äôre enjoying the pleasures of seeing these animals, bird, etc. in as natural an environment that the zoo can provide in the estimated 28 ha available. Here it is that you‚Äôve an opportunity of educating/introducing those same kids to those same responsibilities that you‚Äôve had for much of your life ‚Ä¶. leaving space for the other species. The challenges of doing this with a global population of 8B that is expected to peak at 10B by the second half of the 21st C. remains for future generations (including those kids with you and their descendants). The zoo handles these messages well.\n\nWhilst the traditional animal enclosures ‚Äì looking, at times, rather dated and tired ‚Äì provide the basis of the day‚Äôs exploration, there may also have been a lean towards entertainment of a Disneyesque kind during the time since we were last there. We watched the kids being kangaroos on a timed ‚Äòleaping pad‚Äô (measuring leaps/distance/time), other kids running up/down a couple of boards with foot holds across them ‚Äì again, against the clock (4 secs being the fastest) and still other kids testing their personal strength by lifting buckets on pulleys with different loadings. We don‚Äôt remember those features from earlier. \n\nThe food centres ‚Äì zoo entrance, tram terminal and KFC-centre ‚Äì remain as popular as ever. Larger? More investment? Who knows? Sure, people expect to find facilities of this kind. Have there been similar animal-focussed investment in the modern era? There seems to have been more focus upon entertainment activities associated with ‚Äòwild animals‚Äô including night life, river ventures and bird life rides/worlds. In the pipeline is a rainforest world. Where does the traditional scientific appreciation of ‚Äòwildlife‚Äô become absorbed into ‚Äòmanaged wildlife‚Äô because that may be the likely future for the original indigenous fauna (and flora) everywhere. The Wild Africa section of the zoo is a case in point. All wildlife in Africa is currently at risk of becoming lost as a result of expanding human populations, poverty, insufficient investment and mixed priorities on the part of national governments. The traditional images of Africa remain a reality of earlier times. Wildlife is in decline everywhere on the continent. Singapore zoo and others with a similar vision focus upon domestic breeding programs and the re-introduction/management of species in the wild ‚Äì white rhino and Rothschild giraffe are two examples of where the zoo has been successful.\n\nMore‚Äôs the pity that, as a species, we have been so careless, lacking in understanding and appreciation of the animals, birds, insects, plants and other lifeforms around us and upon which we remain dependent. Messages such as this are found throughout the Zoo when describing the animals that are available, the loss of habitat (and particularly in regional Asia) where, in recent times, plantation agriculture has been replacing the original forests that once provided home and sustenance for animals in the Zoo ‚Äì orangutans, gharials, tigers, Asian rhinos, Asian hippopotamus and others. There‚Äôs a pertinent and really sad message of this kind in the Tiger compound describing the demise of the tiger across Asia ‚Äì just two native homes remain from the entire Asian continent because of persecution/hunting from the 1970s-on. Once found from the Caspian Sea to Eastern China, indigenous tigers can now only be found in India and Malaysia. There are estimated <3,000 tigers in the wild and - all this - has happened during my lifetime.\n\nSo, some serious messages for the future of the species on show at Singapore Zoo, but also some emphasis on the value of national investments of this kind as part of educating everyone (starting with the kids) that they/we are simply one of many species within the fabric of Life on Earth that helps to sustain us. Respect, understanding, science, knowledge and education underly the entertainment value of the Zoo.\n\nIf you live in Singapore, ensure that you support this national icon with an occasional visit. If you‚Äôre travelling through, here‚Äôs an expensive but highly recommended day that will provide a reasonable/confidential/self-assured vision that people of the future may be able to live in an urban/built environment that has come to terms with a sustainable world ‚Äì for all species.\n\nPeter Steele\n21 June 2024"

The animals had free rein of the park and we didn‚Äôt see a single cage the whole time we were there. The monkeys and orangutans have their own sky garden. We were take aback by the animals in the fragile forests and the fact you could walk amongst them. The 2 shows were really fun and entertaining. If you have any doubts about this place I would leave them at home and try for yourself."

      "description": "The breath-taking connection between Faber Peak Singapore and Sentosa Island Established since 1974, Singapore Cable Car is the nation's first and only cableway that links Faber Peak on mainland Singapore to the island resort of Sentosa, before flying you to the Merlion or the sandy beach at Siloso. Today, the cable car rides are enjoyed across a Cable Car Sky Network of more than 100 cabins spanning almost 5 kilometres on the Mount Faber Line and the Sentosa Line. A 'joyride' across the Cable Car Sky Network offers a 360-degree aerial and visual treat of the entire Sentosa-HarbourFront skyline and the resort island. The scenery transforms as the cabins soar above the forest, through a skyscraper, over the harbour and travel across the jungle, sand and sea. Our passionate service ambassadors are on hand to create happy moments for all cable car joyriders. Singapore Cable Car Opening Hours: From 8.45am to 10pm (Last boarding: 9.30pm)",

You take a small boat to Pulau Ubin from a terminal, and you need cash to pay the captain directly, but the view is amazing and pretty smooth. After you get off the boat, you will see bike rentals which I highly recommend. It's also worth taking a look at the map so you don't get lost and you know which trails you want to be on. The bikes are your standard rental ones, mine did fine outside of some uneven uphills on the trails. Look at for monkeys-I was surprised by some that crossed a bit ahead of me so I changed directions. The views are great & there's a lot to see. Bring bug spray."

Impressions of the island was a secluded bush forest environment with abundant wildlife eg. Monkeys, snakes, lizards & very few humans.  After catching the local ferry ie. 12 person bumboat (note that they wait to fill all seats before departing otherwise you may have to negotiate a deal if the boats isn't full).  Once you land & absorb the tranquility of being in a Kampong (village), its off to hire a bicycle of which there were 3 shops opened & they all had 2 types - standard and newer (identified as it has bubble wrap around the stem) starting at $S8-$S10/day. Tip - dont assume that the 'newer' bike is better as one of the bikes suddenly disengaged the handle bars from the wheel & became un-steerable.  We stuck mostly to the roads which were more or less level but did stop to hike to the top for the amazing views.  Afterwards, lunch was in the local village where despite the shabby appearance the food was great with Char Kway Teow a standout.  Beware the 'toilet' which turned out to be a hole in the concrete floor (straight into the drain and into the waterway) with a hose to flush. \nTo conclude, a great experience & opportunity to see another side of Singapore away from the concrete jungle.  Take lotsa water as it is hot and only 1  place along the route to replenish."

You get hassled a bit for bike rental and we ended up paying $8 per bike. Some have new bikes, some not. We just checked the tyres and brakes before we paid. They were bth OK, older bikes.\nThere's plenty of trails that cover the island and they're all well signposted and there's regular shelters and island maps.\nWe went one way as far as the German Girl Shrine - a great, easy ride and along the way there's several other riders, walkers, locals fishing, monkeys, butterflies and even an Otter.\nWe came back to the jetty area and grabbed some lunch which was good and cheap.\nWe then headed off to the Wetlands - another great ride - some pavement, some dirt, some inclines, but nothing too hard for fit people. Heaps of Monkeys, Wild Boars and other wildlife.\nAt the entrance to the Wetlands you have to park your bike (in a bike parking lot) and walk the rest of the way - don't leave anything with your bike, the local Monkeys will take whatever you leave.\nThe walk is pretty flat and there's a boardwalk that's been built that's really good. We also climbed up a lookout tower and got some great views of the canopy and Malaysia across the water.\nBack to get the bikes and there's a thunderstorm on the way - we decide to ride back to the wharf and end up getting caught in a massive tropical rain / thunder / lightning storm. We end up soaked and in a shelter waiting it out for 1/2 an hour or so and we loved every second of it.\nAn amazing day and the island is such a throwback to what life was like - you can't believe you're in Singapore and just a cab ride away from the city.\nOn the way back you have to go through an airport style security screening when you get off the boat.\nMake sure you take - Cash, Camera, Sunscreen, Hat, good walking shoes.\nGreat day out........"

Do take a boat ride which is only a few minutes. Then rent a bike from one of the locals. Don‚Äôt forget to bring your binoculars to view different birds. Give way to the monkeys and wild pigs. Don‚Äôt forget to bring enough water. Admire the different trees and plants along the trail. After the bike ride, order food from one of the small restaurants and just enjoy the view as you relax yourself!"

I estimate we walked about 5 miles over a near 2 hour period. We saw several smallish lizards, Kingfishers, turtles, large fish and a very large monitor, that scuttled underneath the boardwalk as we walked over it. \nWe visited just after rains - the mist rising off the water and through the trees was magical.

There are other galleries here too devoted to the history of art in Singapore & the region, exploring the deep connections between the changes in Singapore and their impact on wider culture and the art scene. I learned so much this morning as this is only my second visit to Singapore and my first with my partner.\n\nThis is where today‚Äôs visit was so special. I love art and have done so for many decades, simply put, my partner is not as interested in it as I am. Yet this visit triggered something. What I thought would only be a 1-2 hours at most visit before my partner became restless turned into a half day visit where quite often we wondered off in different directions exploring on our own only for me to discover my partner intently viewing modern works & sculptures and taking lots and lots of photos of the architecture of the amazing building too. \n\nWhen I asked what was different, the response was simply it did not feel like a normal art gallery and the layout and architecture all combined to create an inviting space for exploration & discovery. I hope this is the start of something new for us. Thank you National Gallery Singapore!"

We resorted to using hotel WiFi and sharing hotspots. Upon returning to Singapore, we visited the shop in hopes of a refund for the unused card, but were informed by the saleswoman who remembered us that refunds were not offered, despite our inability to utilize the data card. Feeling deceived and disappointed, especially after trusting her recommendation to top up for additional GB, we advised the shop to inform customers beforehand about potential issues with the data cards and their no-refund policy. It's regrettable to share this experience, but it's essential to highlight the service quality at this store. There are numerous other mobile service shops in the vicinity worth considering."

The old Bras Basah Road shophouses were later demolished. \n\nWhen the Bras Basah Complex was built, it was designed and designated to be a book centre and the early tenants were book merchants relocated from Bras Basah Road and North Bridge Road.\n\nHowever, now there are other tenants selling of watches, leisure goods. art and craft materials and F&B outlets such as Jack's Place.\n\nI used to frequent the second-hand bookshops here in 2008 in search of Chemistry text books at university level.  These books were often in good conditions and were so much more affordable.  There were also many ten years series on sale here.  I also frequented the stationery shops as well as the printing shop when I needed a poster to be done.  It was also the place to buy textbooks during the December holidays.\n\nStrangely, the National Library is now situated next to it, quite like the good old days."

There are also many other well established shops that focus on timepieces, eye wears, printing services and furniture.\n\nWhile the younger generation likes to go to newer mega bookstores like Kinokuniya, it is Bras Basah Complex that still gives us a chance to step into our history, tradition and culture. \n\nHighly recommended!"
