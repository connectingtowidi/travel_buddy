          "text": "The place is full of great entertainment and fun, The express ticket as they say allows you to access everything without waiting in a queue but that is not true, the staff member outside informed us that there is two types of express ticket, one with exeption for some games where you have to wait in a ling queue and another express when you pay higher price so you access everything without waiting, then when we got inside that was not correct as in some games we were told that we cant use express ticket, and if you will go to repeat one game that you like then you cannot use the express ticket, it's only one time use,  also we had to pay for the dryer after we got wet with water spalsh game, so what's the use of paying extra for express ticket. Many people from different countries are visiting the place there should be a variety of global fast food restaurant, but there is not, also the drinks should be better and have vriety but all the of them sell the same juice every where there. Also one show at water world i missed it some years ago as the last show was at 3 pm, and last week this side was closed for maintenance which was disappointing. They need to have more seating areas with air condition so people can rest in between as the weather is so hot. The experience was overall good but a lot of dissappointments here and there."

Well worth including in your Singapore itinerary."

          "text": "Review of Singapore Zoo\n\nThis was our second visit to Singapore Zoo in two years and we remain as committed to our earlier findings as those of the current day …. The zoo provides an excellent opportunity to catch a glimpse of the complexity of the natural world that surrounds us. Besides looking at the animals in their protective enclosures there’s the underlying messages for conservation, value and appreciation that an entertaining day at the zoo provides. It helps to emphasize the unnatural balance of people worldwide within the demand for resources of land, materials, food, water and living space … with much the same requirements for the other creatures with which we share the planet.\n\nThe messages are there for those who seek them except it’s a lot to ask when you’ve a day out with the kids/family and you’re enjoying the pleasures of seeing these animals, bird, etc. in as natural an environment that the zoo can provide in the estimated 28 ha available. Here it is that you’ve an opportunity of educating/introducing those same kids to those same responsibilities that you’ve had for much of your life …. leaving space for the other species. The challenges of doing this with a global population of 8B that is expected to peak at 10B by the second half of the 21st C. remains for future generations (including those kids with you and their descendants). The zoo handles these messages well.\n\nWhilst the traditional animal enclosures – looking, at times, rather dated and tired – provide the basis of the day’s exploration, there may also have been a lean towards entertainment of a Disneyesque kind during the time since we were last there. We watched the kids being kangaroos on a timed ‘leaping pad’ (measuring leaps/distance/time), other kids running up/down a couple of boards with foot holds across them – again, against the clock (4 secs being the fastest) and still other kids testing their personal strength by lifting buckets on pulleys with different loadings. We don’t remember those features from earlier. \n\nThe food centres – zoo entrance, tram terminal and KFC-centre – remain as popular as ever. Larger? More investment? Who knows? Sure, people expect to find facilities of this kind. Have there been similar animal-focussed investment in the modern era? There seems to have been more focus upon entertainment activities associated with ‘wild animals’ including night life, river ventures and bird life rides/worlds. In the pipeline is a rainforest world. Where does the traditional scientific appreciation of ‘wildlife’ become absorbed into ‘managed wildlife’ because that may be the likely future for the original indigenous fauna (and flora) everywhere. The Wild Africa section of the zoo is a case in point. All wildlife in Africa is currently at risk of becoming lost as a result of expanding human populations, poverty, insufficient investment and mixed priorities on the part of national governments. The traditional images of Africa remain a reality of earlier times. Wildlife is in decline everywhere on the continent. Singapore zoo and others with a similar vision focus upon domestic breeding programs and the re-introduction/management of species in the wild – white rhino and Rothschild giraffe are two examples of where the zoo has been successful.\n\nMore’s the pity that, as a species, we have been so careless, lacking in understanding and appreciation of the animals, birds, insects, plants and other lifeforms around us and upon which we remain dependent. Messages such as this are found throughout the Zoo when describing the animals that are available, the loss of habitat (and particularly in regional Asia) where, in recent times, plantation agriculture has been replacing the original forests that once provided home and sustenance for animals in the Zoo – orangutans, gharials, tigers, Asian rhinos, Asian hippopotamus and others. There’s a pertinent and really sad message of this kind in the Tiger compound describing the demise of the tiger across Asia – just two native homes remain from the entire Asian continent because of persecution/hunting from the 1970s-on. Once found from the Caspian Sea to Eastern China, indigenous tigers can now only be found in India and Malaysia. There are estimated <3,000 tigers in the wild and - all this - has happened during my lifetime.\n\nSo, some serious messages for the future of the species on show at Singapore Zoo, but also some emphasis on the value of national investments of this kind as part of educating everyone (starting with the kids) that they/we are simply one of many species within the fabric of Life on Earth that helps to sustain us. Respect, understanding, science, knowledge and education underly the entertainment value of the Zoo.\n\nIf you live in Singapore, ensure that you support this national icon with an occasional visit. If you’re travelling through, here’s an expensive but highly recommended day that will provide a reasonable/confidential/self-assured vision that people of the future may be able to live in an urban/built environment that has come to terms with a sustainable world – for all species.\n\nPeter Steele\n21 June 2024"

The animals had free rein of the park and we didn’t see a single cage the whole time we were there. The monkeys and orangutans have their own sky garden. We were take aback by the animals in the fragile forests and the fact you could walk amongst them. The 2 shows were really fun and entertaining. If you have any doubts about this place I would leave them at home and try for yourself."

This allowed a full morning to be spent around the gardens, taking in breakfast after a couple of hours and retiring back to our son’s apartment around lunchtime when it became too hot and humid.\n\nSo much has been written about the gardens, there is no real need to add more except to confirm that they are world class, beautifully maintained by a veritable army of gardeners and, amazingly, apart from the orchid garden, free of charge.  They are a favourite with joggers, dog walkers and, as the morning wears on, organised school visits and crocodiles of tourists.  Busy, but never crowded.\n\nThere is always a lot of wildlife around but on our first visit, we did not see Singapore’s famous film-star otters.  There was lots of advice from people about where they were yesterday, or their usual routes between ponds, and there were  birds, terrapins and salamanders a-plenty; but no otters.  Maybe, being film stars, their agent only lets them come out for appearance money these days.\n\nThe second visit also started early and my wife decided that it was necessary to “discuss” which platform to use at Downtown MRT station to get to the gardens.  (Same as on the previous occasion, one might have thought.)  Naturally, she favoured the “other” one.  By the time the discussion was over, we descended to the platform to see the train vanishing down the tunnel.  No matter, it was only two minutes until the next one.  \n\nHowever, they were an important two minutes.  We strolled into the gardens accompanying the usual joggers and dog walkers who take advantage of the cool dawn period, and as we rounded the corner towards the northernmost pond, we were just in time to see the back legs and tail of an otter slip into the water fifty yards away.  By the time we made that spot, the only trace of otters were about half a dozen tiny bow waves at the other side of the pond heading for the reeds.  If only we had not been held up by the “discussion” and missed the train!  Oh well; next time we are in Singapore perhaps.\n\nAnyway, it was still a most pleasing morning around the gardens and they remain, even with elusive otters, a “must see” location in Singapore."

      "description": "The breath-taking connection between Faber Peak Singapore and Sentosa Island Established since 1974, Singapore Cable Car is the nation's first and only cableway that links Faber Peak on mainland Singapore to the island resort of Sentosa, before flying you to the Merlion or the sandy beach at Siloso. Today, the cable car rides are enjoyed across a Cable Car Sky Network of more than 100 cabins spanning almost 5 kilometres on the Mount Faber Line and the Sentosa Line. A 'joyride' across the Cable Car Sky Network offers a 360-degree aerial and visual treat of the entire Sentosa-HarbourFront skyline and the resort island. The scenery transforms as the cabins soar above the forest, through a skyscraper, over the harbour and travel across the jungle, sand and sea. Our passionate service ambassadors are on hand to create happy moments for all cable car joyriders. Singapore Cable Car Opening Hours: From 8.45am to 10pm (Last boarding: 9.30pm)",

      "description": "With a history dating back to its inception in 1887, the National Museum of Singapore is the nation's oldest museum with a progressive mind. Its galleries adopt cutting-edge and multi-perspective ways of presenting history and culture to redefine conventional museum experience. A cultural and architectural landmark in Singapore, the Museum hosts innovative festivals and events all year round-the dynamic Night Festival, visually arresting art installations, as well as amazing performances and film screenings-in addition to presenting thought-provoking exhibitions involving critically important collections of artefacts. The programming is supported by a wide range of facilities and services including F&B, retail and a Resource Centre. The National Museum of Singapore re-opened in December 2006 after a three-year redevelopment, and celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2012. The Museum refreshed its permanent galleries and re-opened them on 19 September 2015 for Singapore's Golden Jubilee.",

We sat up the back (which is uncovered) and had a thoroughly enjoyable time.\n\nWe left at nightfall (dusk) and by halfway through the cruise, it was dark, and Singapore's lights revealed themselves in all their beautiful glory!\n\nThe recorded guide over the speaker was informative and not too loud or intrusive, and we all found it be very interesting and relaxing.\n\nThe 'bumboat' cruise on the river was one of the most pleasant and enjoyable moments of our 6 day stay in Singapore. Highly recommended!"

The dock and the ticket office is at the end of Clarke Quay - very easy to find on the mapping apps. The queue moves quickly as there are multiple boats in operation. You do not need to purchase tickets in advance. We arrived in the evening so that we could see the cityscape lit up, and the views were breathtaking. The cruise is roughly 45 minutes around the harbor and is accompanied with a helpful recorded narration."

Its a short cruise about 40 mins but well worth it as it gives a really good view of the clarke quay and merlion park area and the view of the buildings from the water is really good. Smooth journey and even though it rained a bit  all good as there is a covered par of the ship. The clarke quay embarkation point is very near some restaurants also. Good tips and some funny banter from the guide."

      "description": "Cruising since 1987. For more than a decade and a half, bumboats have been plying the Singapore River. The story of Singapore River Cruise begins in 1987. The \"Clean Rivers Campaign\" of 1983 saw the relocation of bumboats to Pasir Panjang. The familiar painted faces of our Bumboats were due to disappear from its home, until SRC was awarded the tender license to run river services here - the first also, to operate such services along the river. We are entering a new chapter in the Singapore River story. In this modern age, Bumboats on this historic waterway remind us of its rustic charm. SRC has been preserving the heritage of this important river for more than two decades. Its bumboats have become the icon of our river to visitors and locals alike. 2008 was a year when our iconic bumboats underwent a transformation. The diesel-powered engines of SRC's fleet made way for a new generation of electric ones that boast quieter engines and zero CO2 emissions. These are the very boats that operate along the Singapore River today. SRC is committed to greater excellence. Under its strong management, the company has developed a firm network of channel intermediaries from government agencies, embassies, event organizers and other operators in the tourism sector, both local and overseas. From a humble fleet of 4 bumboats in 1987, SRC has since increased its number to 24 today with a few new additions coming onboard soon.",

We found the details of this FREE experience on the Changi Airport web site and booked our places as soon as the booking opened.  We would recommend booking as place on tours are limited and some on the day walk ups were turned away, as our tour was full.  It was a really GREAT experience and gave us views of Singapore, its buildings and areas, that we were then able to visit when we returned for a 4 night stopover at the end of our holiday.  The tour, in a comfortable air conditioned coach, included three stops, where everyone had to leave the coach, take their belongings and walk on the pavement to the attraction.  We only had a small amount of hand luggage and managed fine but we felt that some of the more elderly people on the tour, found this part a little challenging in the heat.  Our guide Lynda was informative and gave us good insight into Singapore and its people.  So if you fulfil the criteria for this free tour and are of reasonable fitness, we would definitely recommend taking it."

The restaurant has a spacious dining area and isn't usually crowded in the mornings, unlike the afternoons. It's also easy to find, located right across from the Indian temple."

We made a reservation in advance like 3 weeks prior & booked through the Marina Bay Sands app & says there that prepaid dinner is required for $238++ per person & is none refundable. We still went ahead & booked it thinking it's once and a lifetime experience. \n\nIt's a 6-course meal (see picture below). We got there and of course the location is breathtaking because it's on the rooftop 57th floor of the MBS hotel overlooking the city. We didn't go there for the view because we are a guest at the hotel so we have free access to the infinity pools, etc. We came to experience dining in. We had high hopes because of the price we paid. Surprisingly disappointing and underwhelming. The ambiance is very casual, thought it was a \"fine dining\" as described & showed in their rez website. For something that is special occasion and couples that choose to celebrate V-Day there, there's nothing special about this place, no red tablecloth with flowers on the tables. Like I said it's very basic & casual. The food is fine but it's not worth of the price we paid. Aside from that, we ordered a glass of mocato and coke zero plus the 750 ml bottle of water they provided, which they also charge $12/bottle and we drank 2 bottles, lol. So our total bill came over S$600++ (minus the prepaid dinner of $238). So it's about $300++ per person which I think is not what worthy. Would I do it again? NO....  but the service was great. \n\nI was told that they're planning to do a renovation of this place, I hope they will upscale it somehow. As a tourists, it's very disappointing...."

Like a Japanese pub.  So naturally, as a patron or first-time visitor, you should be going here for the alcoholic drinks or sake offered first and then enjoy the food with it.  Don't let the reviews on the service fool you.  The service is very good and the wait staff are attentive.  The owner is as well --- make sure to treat his baby as it should be --- a proper izakaya.\n\nThe food selection is great and can be varied depending on the day.  Always ask for what is in season or what is the special.  We ordered a lot from sushi and sashimi and the usual tempura to the different warming soups.  The Maguro Kakuni was excellent.  The Buri-Jiru was an experience on the taste buds.  The menu though is subject to change with the season so make sure to visit during different periods to fully enjoy the varied offerings.\n\nThe sake selection is very respectable.  Several options range from affordable to the garrishly enjoyable.  Make sure to ask for recommendations that go with your food if you need it.\n\nOverall, it is an experience -- a Japanese izakaya that stays true to its identity and soul."

It has array of excellent Japanese Otsumami (tapas), and moreover well selected Sake, mainly of Junmai Ginjyo stock (this does not equate to being the best. As in wine, some people prefer Bourgogne, some haute Medoc, some Cote du Rhone, so goes same for Sake.).  This at an incredibly affordable price for SG.  The staffs are alert, responds quickly, as if this was in Japan.  Probably better than Japan.  There is one catch.  If one is looking for Haute Cuisine under glamorous interior, go another place.  It is dimly lit because the building is old and will not spend an extra cent.  It is clammed. You will get harassed if you are not one of the drink drink and be merry tribe."

Especially since this place is quite well known at this point for having this rule. You shouldn't be surprised, and if it's such a big issue, just don't go.\n\nThe food was great. There were four of us and we ordered quite a few dishes. The food was consistently good, and arrived promptly. We enjoyed every single one. Drinks were excellent as well. Atmosphere was fantastic. I seldom go to Izakayas, but a friend who does both in Singapore and Japan tells me this is as close as it gets."

Of course every dish in the 5-course dinner was perfectly paired with Grand Cru wines! Started with poached veal slices on tuna sauce, followed by a half Boston lobster -divinely cooked! Then an interlude of turkey bolognese shall pasta. Main dish is the pan seared Black Angus beef tenderloin. Perfect dinner ended with a double chocolate brownie! Total cost S$396 for 2."

In the end we were very pleased with the night. We ordered 3 set dinners for my wife, my daughter and myself. Only my wife had the paired wine menu. When we arrived we were the only party in the restaurant , and as such had the full attention of the staff. Another party arrived much later but we were the only diners for the evening.\nThe ambience was excellent, food was excellent, staff was efficient and friendly.\nWe had one novice staff serving us but was able to carry out his roles with guidance.\n\nThe food was the highlight.\n\nWe started with bread, which was warm and fluffy.\n\nWe were then surprised by an order of,\n\nHokkaido Scallops, which I assumed came with the set.\n\nIt was followed by an Appetizer of\n\nMARINATED FOIE GRAS TERRINE\nwith Sour Cherry, Green Apple Salad, Raisin Compote\nand Orange Sauce, paired with \nSatellite Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc 2019, New Zealand.\n\nThen a Pasta of \nLINGUINE PASTA with Smoked Lobster, Cherry Tomato, Fresh Basil Leaves\nand Tangy Tomato Creamed Sauce for myself\n\nand \nRISOTTO\nwith Mixed Forest Mushroom, Black Truffle Salsa, Kale Leaves,\nPuff Wild Rice and Parmesan Cheese Snow\n\nThe Main we ordered was\n\nPAN-ROASTED BLACK ANGUS RIB-EYE STEAK\nwith Banana Shallot, New Potatoes, Baby Carrot, Herb Butter\nand Chicken Glazed paired with \nD’Alamei Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon 2018, Chile\n\nFor Dessert, we had\n\nWARM & COLD RECONSTRUCTED TIRAMISU\nwith Coffee Jelly, Coffee Meringue, Kahlua Syrup,\nWarm Mascarpone Cream and Iced Coffee Granite\n\nand \n\nSOUFFLÉ GLACÉ À L’ORANGE\nwith Grand Marnier Sauce and Mandarin Orange Compote\n\nWe were surprised by a complimentary order of\n\nRaspberry Panna Cotta by the Chef, which we enjoyed immensely.\n\nIt was a dinner that we did not expect!\n\nWe will be back again!\n\nThank you to Lester and his team, and Allan(?) for their hospitality!\n\n*The photos don't do the food justice. We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 hrs of eating and soaking in the ambience."

We hadn’t been particularly concerned about what food it served but we were keen enough to try a few cocktails. \nSo after much anticipation we walked out of there a bit like …… ‘well that was that then’!?!? \nThere was NO feel good factor at all. The experience was almost singularly let down by the rude and practically mute male waiter who had no interpersonal skills and didn’t react to any thanks, smiles or anything. He said the bare essential words required to do only the minimum that he was being paid to do….and he should take some advice - get out of hospitality!!!\nThe satays were fine and the cocktail list is quite fun (although you receive those enormous ice ‘slabs’ in your glasses and seemingly next to no liquid!!!!!) but really I wouldn’t tell anyone to bother going to Potato Head….."

The first round the staff gave me a burger (instead of chicken) and I had to drive all the way back to exchange. However, they gave the wrong items again during the exchange even though I had asked them to open the box and they just said they had given me the spicy chicken.  Similar to feedback by other customers, the staff at waterway really could not be bothered to listen or check the customers' orders."
