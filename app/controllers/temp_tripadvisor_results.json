My kids were the most excited ones!!"},{"title":"Good","text":"The place is full of great entertainment and fun, The express ticket as they say allows you to access everything without waiting in a queue but that is not true, the staff member outside informed us that there is two types of express ticket, one with exeption for some games where you have to wait in a ling queue and another express when you pay higher price so you access everything without waiting, then when we got inside that was not correct as in some games we were told that we cant use express ticket, and if you will go to repeat one game that you like then you cannot use the express ticket, it's only one time use,  also we had to pay for the dryer after we got wet with water spalsh game, so what's the use of paying extra for express ticket. Many people from different countries are visiting the place there should be a variety of global fast food restaurant, but there is not, also the drinks should be better and have vriety but all the of them sell the same juice every where there. Also one show at water world i missed it some years ago as the last show was at 3 pm, and last week this side was closed for maintenance which was disappointing. They need to have more seating areas with air condition so people can rest in between as the weather is so hot. The experience was overall good but a lot of dissappointments here and there."},{"title":"Ok, for a day out","text":"We spent from 10-7pm here, kids enjoyed it, queue times were ok, staff were friendly.\n\nPark feels a bit dated, none of the rides were knuckle rides, some rides were very short.\n\nOverall it was ok"}]},{"name":"Singapore Flyer","address":{"street1":"30 Raffles Avenue","city":"Singapore","country":"Singapore","postalcode":"039803","address_string":"30 Raffles Avenue, Singapore 039803 Singapore"},"description":"At 165 metres tall, Singapore Flyer is a masterpiece of urban architecture and engineering that showcases not only the mesmerizing cosmopolitan cityscape of the tropical Lion City, but even the surrounding islands of Indonesia and parts of Malaysia in all their glory.

It wasn't crowdy, so no long waiting time. Anoying that before actual ride you must go through \"mandatory\" time-capsule exbition halls.\nOverall - recommend as one of must-do in city."},{"title":"Great views over the city","text":"Though quite pricey for the 40 minute circuit, the views from the top are worth it. I did not like the obligatory \"Time Capsule\" passage we had to go through to get to the actual ride!  We arrived on a cloudy afternoon and there was no line, no wait and we had the capsule to ourselves, which was lots of fun!"},{"title":"The interactive bit was a let down","text":"The interactive bit to start was a let down, but to be fair we only wanted to go on the big wheel! Great views of Singapore, wouldn't go back, but I suppose worth it for seeing the sights."}]},{"name":"Singapore Zoo","address":{"street1":"80 Mandai Lake Road","street2":"","city":"Singapore","country":"Singapore","postalcode":"729826","address_string":"80 Mandai Lake Road, Singapore 729826 Singapore"},"description":"Set in a rainforest environment, Singapore Zoo is home to over 2,800 animals from over 300 species of mammals, birds and reptiles.
